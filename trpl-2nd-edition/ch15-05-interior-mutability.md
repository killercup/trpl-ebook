## `RefCell<T>` and the Interior Mutability Pattern

*Interior mutability* is a design pattern in Rust for allowing you to mutate
data even though there are immutable references to that data, which would
normally be disallowed by the borrowing rules. The interior mutability pattern
involves using `unsafe` code inside a data structure to bend Rust's usual rules
around mutation and borrowing. We haven't yet covered unsafe code; we will in
Chapter 19. The interior mutability pattern is used when you can ensure that
the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the compiler can't
ensure that. The `unsafe` code involved is then wrapped in a safe API, and the
outer type is still immutable.

Let's explore this by looking at the `RefCell<T>` type that follows the
interior mutability pattern.

### `RefCell<T>` has Interior Mutability

Unlike `Rc<T>`, the `RefCell<T>` type represents single ownership over the data
that it holds. So, what makes `RefCell<T>` different than a type like `Box<T>`?
Let's recall the borrowing rules we learned in Chapter 4:

1. At any given time, you can have *either* but not both of:
  * One mutable reference.
  * Any number of immutable references.
2. References must always be valid.

With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules' invariants are enforced at
compile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced *at runtime*.
With references, if you break these rules, you'll get a compiler error. With
`RefCell<T>`, if you break these rules, you'll get a `panic!`.

Static analysis, like the Rust compiler performs, is inherently conservative.
There are properties of code that are impossible to detect by analyzing the
code: the most famous is the Halting Problem, which is out of scope of this
book but an interesting topic to research if you're interested.

Because some analysis is impossible, the Rust compiler does not try to even
guess if it can't be sure, so it's conservative and sometimes rejects correct
programs that would not actually violate Rust's guarantees. Put another way, if
Rust accepts an incorrect program, people would not be able to trust in the
guarantees Rust makes. If Rust rejects a correct program, the programmer will
be inconvenienced, but nothing catastrophic can occur. `RefCell<T>` is useful
when you know that the borrowing rules are respected, but the compiler can't
understand that that's true.

Similarly to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded
scenarios. We'll talk about how to get the functionality of `RefCell<T>` in a
multithreaded program in the next chapter on concurrency. For now, all you
need to know is that if you try to use `RefCell<T>` in a multithreaded
context, you'll get a compile time error.

With references, we use the `&` and `&mut` syntax to create references and
mutable references, respectively. But with `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow`
and `borrow_mut` methods, which are part of the safe API that `RefCell<T>` has.
`borrow` returns the smart pointer type `Ref`, and `borrow_mut` returns the
smart pointer type `RefMut`. These two types implement `Deref` so that we can
treat them as if they're regular references. `Ref` and `RefMut` track the
borrows dynamically, and their implementation of `Drop` releases the borrow
dynamically.

Listing 15-14 shows what it looks like to use `RefCell<T>` with functions that
borrow their parameters immutably and mutably. Note that the `data` variable is
declared as immutable with `let data` rather than `let mut data`, yet
`a_fn_that_mutably_borrows` is allowed to borrow the data mutably and make
changes to the data!

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn a_fn_that_immutably_borrows(a: &i32) {
    println!("a is {}", a);
}

fn a_fn_that_mutably_borrows(b: &mut i32) {
    *b += 1;
}

fn demo(r: &RefCell<i32>) {
    a_fn_that_immutably_borrows(&r.borrow());
    a_fn_that_mutably_borrows(&mut r.borrow_mut());
    a_fn_that_immutably_borrows(&r.borrow());
}

fn main() {
    let data = RefCell::new(5);
    demo(&data);
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-14: Using `RefCell<T>`, `borrow`, and
`borrow_mut`</span>

This example prints:

```text
a is 5
a is 6
```

In `main`, we've created a new `RefCell<T>` containing the value 5, and stored
in the variable `data`, declared without the `mut` keyword. We then call the
`demo` function with an immutable reference to `data`: as far as `main` is
concerned, `data` is immutable!

In the `demo` function, we get an immutable reference to the value inside the
`RefCell<T>` by calling the `borrow` method, and we call
`a_fn_that_immutably_borrows` with that immutable reference. More
interestingly, we can get a *mutable* reference to the value inside the
`RefCell<T>` with the `borrow_mut` method, and the function
`a_fn_that_mutably_borrows` is allowed to change the value. We can see that the
next time we call `a_fn_that_immutably_borrows` that prints out the value, it's
6 instead of 5.

### Borrowing Rules are Checked at Runtime on `RefCell<T>`

Recall from Chapter 4 that because of the borrowing rules, this code using
regular references that tries to create two mutable borrows in the same scope
won't compile:

```rust,ignore
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;
```

We'll get this compiler error:

```text
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 -->
  |
5 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |                   - first mutable borrow occurs here
6 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |                   ^ second mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - first borrow ends here
```

In contrast, using `RefCell<T>` and calling `borrow_mut` twice in the same
scope *will* compile, but it'll panic at runtime instead. This code:

```rust,should_panic
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let s = RefCell::new(String::from("hello"));

    let r1 = s.borrow_mut();
    let r2 = s.borrow_mut();
}
```

compiles but panics with the following error when we `cargo run`:

```text
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.83 secs
     Running `target/debug/refcell`
thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError',
/stable-dist-rustc/build/src/libcore/result.rs:868
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

This runtime `BorrowMutError` is similar to the compiler error: it says we've
already borrowed `s` mutably once, so we're not allowed to borrow it again. We
aren't getting around the borrowing rules, we're just choosing to have Rust
enforce them at runtime instead of compile time. You could choose to use
`RefCell<T>` everywhere all the time, but in addition to having to type
`RefCell` a lot, you'd find out about possible problems later (possibly in
production rather than during development). Also, checking the borrowing rules
while your program is running has a performance penalty.

### Multiple Owners of Mutable Data by Combining `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`

So why would we choose to make the tradeoffs that using `RefCell<T>` involves?
Well, remember when we said that `Rc<T>` only lets you have an immutable
reference to `T`? Given that `RefCell<T>` is immutable, but has interior
mutability, we can combine `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>` to get a type that's both
reference counted and mutable. Listing 15-15 shows an example of how to do
that, again going back to our cons list from Listing 15-5. In this example,
instead of storing `i32` values in the cons list, we'll be storing
`Rc<RefCell<i32>>` values. We want to store that type so that we can have an
owner of the value that's not part of the list (the multiple owners
functionality that `Rc<T>` provides), and so we can mutate the inner `i32`
value (the interior mutability functionality that `RefCell<T>` provides):

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(Rc<RefCell<i32>>, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));

    let a = Cons(value.clone(), Rc::new(Nil));
    let shared_list = Rc::new(a);

    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(6)), shared_list.clone());
    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(10)), shared_list.clone());

    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;

    println!("shared_list after = {:?}", shared_list);
    println!("b after = {:?}", b);
    println!("c after = {:?}", c);
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-15: Using `Rc<RefCell<i32>>` to create a
`List` that we can mutate</span>

We're creating a value, which is an instance of `Rc<RefCell<i32>>`. We're
storing it in a variable named `value` because we want to be able to access it
directly later. Then we create a `List` in `a` that has a `Cons` variant that
holds `value`, and `value` needs to be cloned since we want `value` to also
have ownership in addition to `a`. Then we wrap `a` in an `Rc<T>` so that we
can create lists `b` and `c` that start differently but both refer to `a`,
similarly to what we did in Listing 15-12.

Once we have the lists in `shared_list`, `b`, and `c` created, then we add 10
to the 5 in `value` by dereferencing the `Rc<T>` and calling `borrow_mut` on
the `RefCell`.

When we print out `shared_list`, `b`, and `c`, we can see that they all have
the modified value of 15:

```text
shared_list after = Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil)
b after = Cons(RefCell { value: 6 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
c after = Cons(RefCell { value: 10 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
```

This is pretty neat! By using `RefCell<T>`, we can have an outwardly immutable
`List`, but we can use the methods on `RefCell<T>` that provide access to its
interior mutability to be able to modify our data when we need to. The runtime
checks of the borrowing rules that `RefCell<T>` does protect us from data
races, and we've decided that we want to trade a bit of speed for the
flexibility in our data structures.

`RefCell<T>` is not the only standard library type that provides interior
mutability. `Cell<T>` is similar but instead of giving references to the inner
value like `RefCell<T>` does, the value is copied in and out of the `Cell<T>`.
`Mutex<T>` offers interior mutability that is safe to use across threads, and
we'll be discussing its use in the next chapter on concurrency. Check out the
standard library docs for more details on the differences between these types.
