# More about Cargo and Crates.io

We've used some features of Cargo in this book so far, but only the most basic
ones. We've used Cargo to build, run, and test our code, but it can do a lot
more. Let's go over some of its other features now. Cargo can do even more than
what we will cover in this chapter; for a full explanation, see its
documentation.

We're going to cover:

* Customizing your build through release profiles
* Publishing libraries on crates.io
* Organizing larger projects with workspaces
* Installing binaries from crates.io
* Extending Cargo with your own custom commands
