# Introduction


Welcome! This book will teach you about the [Rust Programming Language][readme--rust].
Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed,
and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector,
making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t
good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time
requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating
systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a
number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while
eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’
even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language.
Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.

# Getting Started {#sec--getting-started}


This first chapter of the book will get us going with Rust and its tooling.
First, we’ll install Rust. Then, the classic ‘Hello World’ program. Finally,
we’ll talk about Cargo, Rust’s build system and package manager.

### Installing Rust

The first step to using Rust is to install it. Generally speaking, you’ll need
an Internet connection to run the commands in this section, as we’ll be
downloading Rust from the internet.

We’ll be showing off a number of commands using a terminal, and those lines all
start with `$`. We don't need to type in the `$`s, they are there to indicate
the start of each command. We’ll see many tutorials and examples around the web
that follow this convention: `$` for commands run as our regular user, and `#`
for commands we should be running as an administrator.

#### Platform support

The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of platforms, though
not all platforms are equally supported. Rust's support levels are organized
into three tiers, each with a different set of guarantees.

Platforms are identified by their "target triple" which is the string to inform
the compiler what kind of output should be produced. The columns below indicate
whether the corresponding component works on the specified platform.

##### Tier 1

Tier 1 platforms can be thought of as "guaranteed to build and work".
Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:

* Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.
* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on
  tests passing.
* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.
* Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.

##### Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms can be thought of as "guaranteed to build". Automated tests
are not run so it's not guaranteed to produce a working build, but platforms
often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Specifically,
these platforms are required to have each of the following:

* Automated building is set up, but may not be running tests.
* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on
  platforms **building**. Note that this means for some platforms only the
  standard library is compiled, but for others the full bootstrap is run.
* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.

##### Tier 3

Tier 3 platforms are those which Rust has support for, but landing changes is
not gated on the platform either building or passing tests. Working builds for
these platforms may be spotty as their reliability is often defined in terms of
community contributions. Additionally, release artifacts and installers are not
provided, but there may be community infrastructure producing these in
unofficial locations.

Note that this table can be expanded over time, this isn't the exhaustive set of
tier 3 platforms that will ever be!

#### Installing on Linux or Mac

If we're on Linux or a Mac, all we need to do is open a terminal and type this:

```bash
$ curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
```

This will download a script, and start the installation. If it all goes well,
you’ll see this appear:

```text
Welcome to Rust.

This script will download the Rust compiler and its package manager, Cargo, and
install them to /usr/local. You may install elsewhere by running this script
with the --prefix=<path> option.

The installer will run under ‘sudo’ and may ask you for your password. If you do
not want the script to run ‘sudo’ then pass it the --disable-sudo flag.

You may uninstall later by running /usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh,
or by running this script again with the --uninstall flag.

Continue? (y/N)
```

From here, press `y` for ‘yes’, and then follow the rest of the prompts.

#### Installing on Windows

If you're on Windows, please download the appropriate [installer][getting-started.md--install-page].

[getting-started.md--install-page]: https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html

#### Uninstalling

Uninstalling Rust is as easy as installing it. On Linux or Mac, run
the uninstall script:

```bash
$ sudo /usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh
```

If we used the Windows installer, we can re-run the `.msi` and it will give us
an uninstall option.

#### Troubleshooting

If we've got Rust installed, we can open up a shell, and type this:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date.

If you do, Rust has been installed successfully! Congrats!

If you don't and you're on Windows, check that Rust is in your %PATH% system
variable. If it isn't, run the installer again, select "Change" on the "Change,
repair, or remove installation" page and ensure "Add to PATH" is installed on
the local hard drive.

Rust does not do its own linking, and so you’ll need to have a linker
installed. Doing so will depend on your specific system, consult its
documentation for more details.

If not, there are a number of places where we can get help. The easiest is
[the #rust IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org][getting-started.md--irc], which we can access through
[Mibbit][getting-started.md--mibbit]. Click that link, and we'll be chatting with other Rustaceans
(a silly nickname we call ourselves) who can help us out. Other great resources
include [the user’s forum][getting-started.md--users], and [Stack Overflow][getting-started.md--stackoverflow].

[getting-started.md--users]: https://users.rust-lang.org/
[getting-started.md--stackoverflow]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust

This installer also installs a copy of the documentation locally, so we can
read it offline. On UNIX systems, `/usr/local/share/doc/rust` is the location.
On Windows, it's in a `share/doc` directory, inside the directory to which Rust
was installed.

### Hello, world!

Now that you have Rust installed, we'll help you write your first Rust program.
It's traditional when learning a new language to write a little program to
print the text “Hello, world!” to the screen, and in this section, we'll follow
that tradition.

The nice thing about starting with such a simple program is that you can
quickly verify that your compiler is installed, and that it's working properly.
Printing information to the screen is also a pretty common thing to do, so
practicing it early on is good.

#### Creating a Project File

First, make a file to put your Rust code in. Rust doesn't care where your code
lives, but for this book, I suggest making a *projects* directory in your home
directory, and keeping all your projects there. Open a terminal and enter the
following commands to make a directory for this particular project:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

> Note: If you’re on Windows and not using PowerShell, the `~` may not work.
> Consult the documentation for your shell for more details.

#### Writing and Running a Rust Program

Next, make a new source file and call it *main.rs*. Rust files always end
in a *.rs* extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, use
an underscore to separate them; for example, you'd use *hello_world.rs* rather
than *helloworld.rs*.

Now open the *main.rs* file you just created, and type the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Save the file, and go back to your terminal window. On Linux or OSX, enter the
following commands:

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

In Windows, replace `main` with `main.exe`. Regardless of your operating
system, you should see the string `Hello, world!` print to the terminal. If you
did, then congratulations! You've officially written a Rust program. That makes
you a Rust programmer! Welcome.

#### Anatomy of a Rust Program

Now, let’s go over what just happened in your "Hello, world!" program in
detail. Here's the first piece of the puzzle:

```rust
fn main() {

}
```

These lines define a *function* in Rust. The `main` function is special: it's
the beginning of every Rust program. The first line says, “I’m declaring a
function named `main` that takes no arguments and returns nothing.” If there
were arguments, they would go inside the parentheses (`(` and `)`), and because
we aren’t returning anything from this function, we can omit the return type
entirely.

Also note that the function body is wrapped in curly braces (`{` and `}`). Rust
requires these around all function bodies. It's considered good style to put
the opening curly brace on the same line as the function declaration, with one
space in between.

Inside the `main()` function:

```rust
    println!("Hello, world!");
```

This line does all of the work in this little program: it prints text to the
screen. There are a number of details that are important here. The first is
that it’s indented with four spaces, not tabs.

The second important part is the `println!()` line. This is calling a Rust
*[macro]*, which is how metaprogramming is done in Rust. If it were calling a
function instead, it would look like this: `println()` (without the !). We'll
discuss Rust macros in more detail later, but for now you only need to
know that when you see a `!` that means that you’re calling a macro instead of
a normal function.


[getting-started.md--macro]: #sec--macros

Next is `"Hello, world!"` which is a *string*. Strings are a surprisingly
complicated topic in a systems programming language, and this is a *[statically
allocated]* string. We pass this string as an argument to `println!`, which
prints the string to the screen. Easy enough!

[getting-started.md--statically allocated]: #sec--the-stack-and-the-heap

The line ends with a semicolon (`;`). Rust is an *[expression-oriented
language]*, which means that most things are expressions, rather than
statements. The `;` indicates that this expression is over, and the next one is
ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a `;`.

[getting-started.md--expression-oriented language]: #expression-oriented-language

#### Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps

In "Writing and Running a Rust Program", we showed you how to run a newly
created program. We'll break that process down and examine each step now.

Before running a Rust program, you have to compile it. You can use the Rust
compiler by entering the `rustc` command and passing it the name of your source
file, like this:

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
```

If you come from a C or C++ background, you'll notice that this is similar to
`gcc` or `clang`. After compiling successfully, Rust should output a binary
executable, which you can see on Linux or OSX by entering the `ls` command in
your shell as follows:

```bash
$ ls
main  main.rs
```

On Windows, you'd enter:

```bash
$ dir
main.exe  main.rs
```

This shows we have two files: the source code, with an `.rs` extension, and the
executable (`main.exe` on Windows, `main` everywhere else). All that's left to
do from here is run the `main` or `main.exe` file, like this:

```bash
$ ./main  # or main.exe on Windows
```

If *main.rs* were your "Hello, world!" program, this would print `Hello,
world!` to your terminal.

If you come from a dynamic language like Ruby, Python, or JavaScript, you may
not be used to compiling and running a program being separate steps. Rust is an
*ahead-of-time compiled* language, which means that you can compile a program,
give it to someone else, and they can run it even without Rust installed. If
you give someone a `.rb` or `.py` or `.js` file, on the other hand, they need
to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively),
but you only need one command to both compile and run your program. Everything
is a tradeoff in language design.

Just compiling with `rustc` is fine for simple programs, but as your project
grows, you'll want to be able to manage all of the options your project has,
and make it easy to share your code with other people and projects. Next, I'll
introduce you to a tool called Cargo, which will help you write real-world Rust
programs.

### Hello, Cargo!

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager, and Rustaceans use Cargo to
manage their Rust projects. Cargo manages three things: building your code,
downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.
We call libraries your code needs ‘dependencies’ since your code depends on
them.

The simplest Rust programs don’t have any dependencies, so right now, you'd
only use the first part of its functionality. As you write more complex Rust
programs, you’ll want to add dependencies, and if you start off using Cargo,
that will be a lot easier to do.

As the vast, vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, we will assume that
you’re using it for the rest of the book. Cargo comes installed with Rust
itself, if you used the official installers. If you installed Rust through some
other means, you can check if you have Cargo installed by typing:

```bash
$ cargo --version
```

Into a terminal. If you see a version number, great! If you see an error like
‘`command not found`’, then you should look at the documentation for the system
in which you installed Rust, to determine if Cargo is separate.

#### Converting to Cargo

Let’s convert the Hello World program to Cargo. To Cargo-fy a project, you need
to do three things:

1. Put your source file in the right directory.
2. Get rid of the old executable (`main.exe` on Windows, `main` everywhere else)
   and make a new one.
3. Make a Cargo configuration file.

Let's get started!

##### Creating a new Executable and Source Directory

First, go back to your terminal, move to your *hello_world* directory, and
enter the following commands:

```bash
$ mkdir src
$ mv main.rs src/main.rs
$ rm main  # or 'del main.exe' on Windows
```

Cargo expects your source files to live inside a *src* directory, so do that
first. This leaves the top-level project directory (in this case,
*hello_world*) for READMEs, license information, and anything else not related
to your code. In this way, using Cargo helps you keep your projects nice and
tidy. There's a place for everything, and everything is in its place.

Now, copy *main.rs* to the *src* directory, and delete the compiled file you
created with `rustc`. As usual, replace `main` with `main.exe` if you're on
Windows.

This example retains `main.rs` as the source filename because it's creating an
executable. If you wanted to make a library instead, you'd name the file
`lib.rs`. This convention is used by Cargo to successfully compile your
projects, but it can be overridden if you wish.

##### Creating a Configuration File

Next, create a new file inside your *hello_world* directory, and call it
`Cargo.toml`.

Make sure to capitalize the `C` in `Cargo.toml`, or Cargo won't know what to do
with the configuration file.

This file is in the *[TOML]* (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format. TOML is
similar to INI, but has some extra goodies, and is used as Cargo’s
configuration format.

[getting-started.md--TOML]: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

Inside this file, type the following information:

```toml
[package]

name = "hello_world"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = [ "Your name <you@example.com>" ]
```

The first line, `[package]`, indicates that the following statements are
configuring a package. As we add more information to this file, we’ll add other
sections, but for now, we only have the package configuration.

The other three lines set the three bits of configuration that Cargo needs to
know to compile your program: its name, what version it is, and who wrote it.

Once you've added this information to the *Cargo.toml* file, save it to finish
creating the configuration file.

#### Building and Running a Cargo Project

With your *Cargo.toml* file in place in your project's root directory, you
should be ready to build and run your Hello World program! To do so, enter the
following commands:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_world v0.0.1 (file:///home/yourname/projects/hello_world)
$ ./target/debug/hello_world
Hello, world!
```

Bam! If all goes well, `Hello, world!` should print to the terminal once more.

You just built a project with `cargo build` and ran it with
`./target/debug/hello_world`, but you can actually do both in one step with
`cargo run` as follows:

```bash
$ cargo run
     Running `target/debug/hello_world`
Hello, world!
```

Notice that this example didn’t re-build the project. Cargo figured out that
the file hasn’t changed, and so it just ran the binary. If you'd modified your
source code, Cargo would have rebuilt the project before running it, and you
would have seen something like this:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_world v0.0.1 (file:///home/yourname/projects/hello_world)
     Running `target/debug/hello_world`
Hello, world!
```

Cargo checks to see if any of your project’s files have been modified, and only
rebuilds your project if they’ve changed since the last time you built it.

With simple projects, Cargo doesn't bring a whole lot over just using `rustc`,
but it will become useful in future. This is especially true when you start
using crates; these are synonymous with a ‘library’ or ‘package’ in other
programming languages. For complex projects composed of multiple crates, it’s
much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build. Using Cargo, you can run `cargo
build`, and it should work the right way.

##### Building for Release

When your project is ready for release, you can use `cargo build
--release` to compile your project with optimizations. These optimizations make
your Rust code run faster, but turning them on makes your program take longer
to compile. This is why there are two different profiles, one for development,
and one for building the final program you’ll give to a user.

##### What Is That `Cargo.lock`?

Running `cargo build` also causes Cargo to create a new file called
*Cargo.lock*, which looks like this:

```toml
[root]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.0.1"
```

Cargo uses the *Cargo.lock* file to keep track of dependencies in your
application. This is the Hello World project's *Cargo.lock* file. This project
doesn't have dependencies, so the file is a bit sparse. Realistically, you
won't ever need to touch this file yourself; just let Cargo handle it.

That’s it! If you've been following along, you should have successfully built
`hello_world` with Cargo.

Even though the project is simple, it now uses much of the real tooling you’ll
use for the rest of your Rust career. In fact, you can expect to start
virtually all Rust projects with some variation on the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone someurl.com/foo
$ cd foo
$ cargo build
```

#### Making A New Cargo Project the Easy Way

You don’t have to go through that previous process every time you want to start
a new project! Cargo can quickly make a bare-bones project directory that you
can start developing in right away.

To start a new project with Cargo, enter `cargo new` at the command line:

```bash
$ cargo new hello_world --bin
```

This command passes `--bin` because the goal is to get straight to making an
executable application, as opposed to a library. Executables are often called
*binaries* (as in `/usr/bin`, if you’re on a Unix system).

Cargo has generated two files and one directory for us: a `Cargo.toml` and a
*src* directory with a *main.rs* file inside. These should look familiar,
they’re exactly what we created by hand, above.

This output is all you need to get started. First, open `Cargo.toml`. It should
look something like this:

```toml
[package]

name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
```

Cargo has populated *Cargo.toml* with reasonable defaults based on the arguments
you gave it and your `git` global configuration. You may notice that Cargo has
also initialized the `hello_world` directory as a `git` repository.

Here’s what should be in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Cargo has generated a "Hello World!" for you, and you’re ready to start coding!

guide], which covers all of its features.

### Closing Thoughts

This chapter covered the basics that will serve you well through the rest of
this book, and the rest of your time with Rust. Now that you’ve got the tools
down, we'll cover more about the Rust language itself.

You have two options: Dive into a project with ‘[Tutorial: Guessing Game][getting-started.md--guessinggame]’, or
start from the bottom and work your way up with ‘[Syntax and
Semantics][getting-started.md--syntax]’. More experienced systems programmers will probably prefer
‘Tutorial: Guessing Game’, while those from dynamic backgrounds may enjoy either. Different
people learn differently! Choose whatever’s right for you.

# Tutorial: Guessing Game {#sec--guessing-game}


Let’s learn some Rust! For our first project, we’ll implement a classic
beginner programming problem: the guessing game. Here’s how it works: Our
program will generate a random integer between one and a hundred. It will then
prompt us to enter a guess. Upon entering our guess, it will tell us if we’re
too low or too high. Once we guess correctly, it will congratulate us. Sounds
good?

Along the way, we’ll learn a little bit about Rust. The next chapter, ‘Syntax
and Semantics’, will dive deeper into each part.

### Set up

Let’s set up a new project. Go to your projects directory. Remember how we had
to create our directory structure and a `Cargo.toml` for `hello_world`? Cargo
has a command that does that for us. Let’s give it a shot:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects
$ cargo new guessing_game --bin
$ cd guessing_game
```

We pass the name of our project to `cargo new`, and then the `--bin` flag,
since we’re making a binary, rather than a library.

Check out the generated `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]

name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
```

Cargo gets this information from your environment. If it’s not correct, go ahead
and fix that.

Finally, Cargo generated a ‘Hello, world!’ for us. Check out `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Let’s try compiling what Cargo gave us:

```{bash}
$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
```

Excellent! Open up your `src/main.rs` again. We’ll be writing all of
our code in this file.

Before we move on, let me show you one more Cargo command: `run`. `cargo run`
is kind of like `cargo build`, but it also then runs the produced executable.
Try it out:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Hello, world!
```

Great! The `run` command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a
project. Our game is such a project, we need to quickly test each
iteration before moving on to the next one.

### Processing a Guess

Let’s get to it! The first thing we need to do for our guessing game is
allow our player to input a guess. Put this in your `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

There’s a lot here! Let’s go over it, bit by bit.

```rust
use std::io;
```

We’ll need to take user input, and then print the result as output. As such, we
need the `io` library from the standard library. Rust only imports a few things
by default into every program, [the ‘prelude’][guessing-game.md--prelude]. If it’s not in the
prelude, you’ll have to `use` it directly. There is also a second ‘prelude’, the
[`io` prelude][guessing-game.md--ioprelude], which serves a similar function: you import it, and it
imports a number of useful, `io`-related things.

[guessing-game.md--prelude]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html
[guessing-game.md--ioprelude]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/prelude/index.html

```rust
fn main() {
```

As you’ve seen before, the `main()` function is the entry point into your
program. The `fn` syntax declares a new function, the `()`s indicate that
there are no arguments, and `{` starts the body of the function. Because
we didn’t include a return type, it’s assumed to be `()`, an empty
[tuple][guessing-game.md--tuples].

[guessing-game.md--tuples]: #tuples

```rust
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");
```

We previously learned that `println!()` is a [macro][guessing-game.md--macros] that
prints a [string][guessing-game.md--strings] to the screen.

[guessing-game.md--macros]: #sec--macros
[guessing-game.md--strings]: #sec--strings

```rust
    let mut guess = String::new();
```

Now we’re getting interesting! There’s a lot going on in this little line.
The first thing to notice is that this is a [let statement][guessing-game.md--let], which is
used to create ‘variable bindings’. They take this form:

```rust
let foo = bar;
```

[guessing-game.md--let]: #sec--variable-bindings

This will create a new binding named `foo`, and bind it to the value `bar`. In
many languages, this is called a ‘variable’, but Rust’s variable bindings have
a few tricks up their sleeves.

For example, they’re [immutable][guessing-game.md--immutable] by default. That’s why our example
uses `mut`: it makes a binding mutable, rather than immutable. `let` doesn’t
take a name on the left hand side of the assignment, it actually accepts a
‘[pattern][guessing-game.md--patterns]’. We’ll use patterns later. It’s easy enough
to use for now:

```rust
let foo = 5; // immutable.
let mut bar = 5; // mutable
```

[guessing-game.md--immutable]: #sec--mutability
[guessing-game.md--patterns]: #sec--patterns

Oh, and `//` will start a comment, until the end of the line. Rust ignores
everything in [comments][guessing-game.md--comments].

[guessing-game.md--comments]: #sec--comments

So now we know that `let mut guess` will introduce a mutable binding named
`guess`, but we have to look at the other side of the `=` for what it’s
bound to: `String::new()`.

`String` is a string type, provided by the standard library. A
[`String`][guessing-game.md--string] is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

[guessing-game.md--string]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html

The `::new()` syntax uses `::` because this is an ‘associated function’ of
a particular type. That is to say, it’s associated with `String` itself,
rather than a particular instance of a `String`. Some languages call this a
‘static method’.

This function is named `new()`, because it creates a new, empty `String`.
You’ll find a `new()` function on many types, as it’s a common name for making
a new value of some kind.

Let’s move forward:

```rust
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
```

That’s a lot more! Let’s go bit-by-bit. The first line has two parts. Here’s
the first:

```rust
io::stdin()
```

Remember how we `use`d `std::io` on the first line of the program? We’re now
calling an associated function on it. If we didn’t `use std::io`, we could
have written this line as `std::io::stdin()`.

This particular function returns a handle to the standard input for your
terminal. More specifically, a [std::io::Stdin][guessing-game.md--iostdin].

[guessing-game.md--iostdin]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html

The next part will use this handle to get input from the user:

```rust
.read_line(&mut guess)
```

Here, we call the [`read_line()`][guessing-game.md--read_line] method on our handle.
[Methods][guessing-game.md--method] are like associated functions, but are only available on a
particular instance of a type, rather than the type itself. We’re also passing
one argument to `read_line()`: `&mut guess`.

[guessing-game.md--read_line]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line
[guessing-game.md--method]: #sec--method-syntax

Remember how we bound `guess` above? We said it was mutable. However,
`read_line` doesn’t take a `String` as an argument: it takes a `&mut String`.
Rust has a feature called ‘[references][guessing-game.md--references]’, which allows you to have
multiple references to one piece of data, which can reduce copying. References
are a complex feature, as one of Rust’s major selling points is how safe and
easy it is to use references. We don’t need to know a lot of those details to
finish our program right now, though. For now, all we need to know is that
like `let` bindings, references are immutable by default. Hence, we need to
write `&mut guess`, rather than `&guess`.

Why does `read_line()` take a mutable reference to a string? Its job is
to take what the user types into standard input, and place that into a
string. So it takes that string as an argument, and in order to add
the input, it needs to be mutable.

[guessing-game.md--references]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

But we’re not quite done with this line of code, though. While it’s
a single line of text, it’s only the first part of the single logical line of
code:

```rust
        .expect("Failed to read line");
```

When you call a method with the `.foo()` syntax, you may introduce a newline
and other whitespace. This helps you split up long lines. We _could_ have
done:

```rust
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("failed to read line");
```

But that gets hard to read. So we’ve split it up, two lines for two method
calls. We already talked about `read_line()`, but what about `expect()`? Well,
we already mentioned that `read_line()` puts what the user types into the `&mut
String` we pass it. But it also returns a value: in this case, an
[`io::Result`][guessing-game.md--ioresult]. Rust has a number of types named `Result` in its
standard library: a generic [`Result`][guessing-game.md--result], and then specific versions for
sub-libraries, like `io::Result`.

[guessing-game.md--ioresult]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html
[guessing-game.md--result]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html

The purpose of these `Result` types is to encode error handling information.
Values of the `Result` type, like any type, have methods defined on them. In
this case, `io::Result` has an [`expect()` method][guessing-game.md--expect] that takes a value
it’s called on, and if it isn’t a successful one, [`panic!`][guessing-game.md--panic]s with a
message you passed it. A `panic!` like this will cause our program to crash,
displaying the message.

[guessing-game.md--expect]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect
[guessing-game.md--panic]: #sec--error-handling

If we leave off calling this method, our program will compile, but
we’ll get a warning:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
src/main.rs:10:5: 10:39 warning: unused result which must be used,
#[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default
src/main.rs:10     io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Rust warns us that we haven’t used the `Result` value. This warning comes from
a special annotation that `io::Result` has. Rust is trying to tell you that
you haven’t handled a possible error. The right way to suppress the error is
to actually write error handling. Luckily, if we want to crash if there’s
a problem, we can use these two little methods. If we can recover from the
error somehow, we’d do something else, but we’ll save that for a future
project.

There’s only one line of this first example left:

```rust
    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

This prints out the string we saved our input in. The `{}`s are a placeholder,
and so we pass it `guess` as an argument. If we had multiple `{}`s, we would
pass multiple arguments:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x and y: {} and {}", x, y);
```

Easy.

Anyway, that’s the tour. We can run what we have with `cargo run`:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
Please input your guess.
6
You guessed: 6
```

All right! Our first part is done: we can get input from the keyboard,
and then print it back out.

### Generating a secret number

Next, we need to generate a secret number. Rust does not yet include random
number functionality in its standard library. The Rust team does, however,
provide a [`rand` crate][guessing-game.md--randcrate]. A ‘crate’ is a package of Rust code.
We’ve been building a ‘binary crate’, which is an executable. `rand` is a
‘library crate’, which contains code that’s intended to be used with other
programs.

[guessing-game.md--randcrate]: https://crates.io/crates/rand

Using external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we can write
the code using `rand`, we need to modify our `Cargo.toml`. Open it up, and
add these few lines at the bottom:

```toml
[dependencies]

rand="0.3.0"
```

The `[dependencies]` section of `Cargo.toml` is like the `[package]` section:
everything that follows it is part of it, until the next section starts.
Cargo uses the dependencies section to know what dependencies on external
crates you have, and what versions you require. In this case, we’ve specified version `0.3.0`,
which Cargo understands to be any release that’s compatible with this specific version.
Cargo understands [Semantic Versioning][guessing-game.md--semver], which is a standard for writing version
numbers. A bare number like above is actually shorthand for `^0.3.0`,
meaning "anything compatible with 0.3.0".
If we wanted to use only `0.3.0` exactly, we could say `rand="=0.3.0"`
(note the two equal signs).
And if we wanted to use the latest version we could use `*`.
We could also use a range of versions.
[Cargo’s documentation][guessing-game.md--cargodoc] contains more details.

[guessing-game.md--semver]: http://semver.org
[guessing-game.md--cargodoc]: http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html

Now, without changing any of our code, let’s build our project:

```bash
$ cargo build
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
 Downloading rand v0.3.8
 Downloading libc v0.1.6
   Compiling libc v0.1.6
   Compiling rand v0.3.8
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
```

(You may see different versions, of course.)

Lots of new output! Now that we have an external dependency, Cargo fetches the
latest versions of everything from the registry, which is a copy of data from
[Crates.io][guessing-game.md--cratesio]. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem
post their open source Rust projects for others to use.

[guessing-game.md--cratesio]: https://crates.io

After updating the registry, Cargo checks our `[dependencies]` and downloads
any we don’t have yet. In this case, while we only said we wanted to depend on
`rand`, we’ve also grabbed a copy of `libc`. This is because `rand` depends on
`libc` to work. After downloading them, it compiles them, and then compiles
our project.

If we run `cargo build` again, we’ll get different output:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

That’s right, no output! Cargo knows that our project has been built, and that
all of its dependencies are built, and so there’s no reason to do all that
stuff. With nothing to do, it simply exits. If we open up `src/main.rs` again,
make a trivial change, and then save it again, we’ll only see one line:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
```

So, we told Cargo we wanted any `0.3.x` version of `rand`, and so it fetched the latest
version at the time this was written, `v0.3.8`. But what happens when next
week, version `v0.3.9` comes out, with an important bugfix? While getting
bugfixes is important, what if `0.3.9` contains a regression that breaks our
code?

The answer to this problem is the `Cargo.lock` file you’ll now find in your
project directory. When you build your project for the first time, Cargo
figures out all of the versions that fit your criteria, and then writes them
to the `Cargo.lock` file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo
will see that the `Cargo.lock` file exists, and then use that specific version
rather than do all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you
have a repeatable build automatically. In other words, we’ll stay at `0.3.8`
until we explicitly upgrade, and so will anyone who we share our code with,
thanks to the lock file.

What about when we _do_ want to use `v0.3.9`? Cargo has another command,
`update`, which says ‘ignore the lock, figure out all the latest versions that
fit what we’ve specified. If that works, write those versions out to the lock
file’. But, by default, Cargo will only look for versions larger than `0.3.0`
and smaller than `0.4.0`. If we want to move to `0.4.x`, we’d have to update
the `Cargo.toml` directly. When we do, the next time we `cargo build`, Cargo
will update the index and re-evaluate our `rand` requirements.

There’s a lot more to say about [Cargo][guessing-game.md--doccargo] and [its
ecosystem][guessing-game.md--doccratesio], but for now, that’s all we need to know. Cargo makes
it really easy to re-use libraries, and so Rustaceans tend to write smaller
projects which are assembled out of a number of sub-packages.

[guessing-game.md--doccargo]: http://doc.crates.io
[guessing-game.md--doccratesio]: http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html

Let’s get on to actually _using_ `rand`. Here’s our next step:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

The first thing we’ve done is change the first line. It now says
`extern crate rand`. Because we declared `rand` in our `[dependencies]`, we
can use `extern crate` to let Rust know we’ll be making use of it. This also
does the equivalent of a `use rand;` as well, so we can make use of anything
in the `rand` crate by prefixing it with `rand::`.

Next, we added another `use` line: `use rand::Rng`. We’re going to use a
method in a moment, and it requires that `Rng` be in scope to work. The basic
idea is this: methods are defined on something called ‘traits’, and for the
method to work, it needs the trait to be in scope. For more about the
details, read the [traits][guessing-game.md--traits] section.

[guessing-game.md--traits]: #sec--traits

There are two other lines we added, in the middle:

```rust
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);
```

We use the `rand::thread_rng()` function to get a copy of the random number
generator, which is local to the particular [thread][guessing-game.md--concurrency] of execution
we’re in. Because we `use rand::Rng`’d above, it has a `gen_range()` method
available. This method takes two arguments, and generates a number between
them. It’s inclusive on the lower bound, but exclusive on the upper bound,
so we need `1` and `101` to get a number ranging from one to a hundred.

[guessing-game.md--concurrency]: #sec--concurrency

The second line prints out the secret number. This is useful while
we’re developing our program, so we can easily test it out. But we’ll be
deleting it for the final version. It’s not much of a game if it prints out
the answer when you start it up!

Try running our new program a few times:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 7
Please input your guess.
4
You guessed: 4
$ cargo run
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 83
Please input your guess.
5
You guessed: 5
```

Great! Next up: comparing our guess to the secret number.

### Comparing guesses

Now that we’ve got user input, let’s compare our guess to the secret number.
Here’s our next step, though it doesn’t quite compile yet:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal   => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

A few new bits here. The first is another `use`. We bring a type called
`std::cmp::Ordering` into scope. Then, five new lines at the bottom that use
it:

```rust
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
    Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
    Ordering::Equal   => println!("You win!"),
}
```

The `cmp()` method can be called on anything that can be compared, and it
takes a reference to the thing you want to compare it to. It returns the
`Ordering` type we `use`d earlier. We use a [`match`][guessing-game.md--match] statement to
determine exactly what kind of `Ordering` it is. `Ordering` is an
[`enum`][guessing-game.md--enum], short for ‘enumeration’, which looks like this:

```rust
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
}
```

[guessing-game.md--match]: #sec--match
[guessing-game.md--enum]: #sec--enums

With this definition, anything of type `Foo` can be either a
`Foo::Bar` or a `Foo::Baz`. We use the `::` to indicate the
namespace for a particular `enum` variant.

The [`Ordering`][guessing-game.md--ordering] `enum` has three possible variants: `Less`, `Equal`,
and `Greater`. The `match` statement takes a value of a type, and lets you
create an ‘arm’ for each possible value. Since we have three types of
`Ordering`, we have three arms:

```rust
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
    Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
    Ordering::Equal   => println!("You win!"),
}
```

[guessing-game.md--ordering]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html

If it’s `Less`, we print `Too small!`, if it’s `Greater`, `Too big!`, and if
`Equal`, `You win!`. `match` is really useful, and is used often in Rust.

I did mention that this won’t quite compile yet, though. Let’s try it:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
src/main.rs:28:21: 28:35 error: mismatched types:
 expected `&collections::string::String`,
    found `&_`
(expected struct `collections::string::String`,
    found integral variable) [E0308]
src/main.rs:28     match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `guessing_game`.
```

Whew! This is a big error. The core of it is that we have ‘mismatched types’.
Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference.
When we wrote `let guess = String::new()`, Rust was able to infer that `guess`
should be a `String`, and so it doesn’t make us write out the type. And with
our `secret_number`, there are a number of types which can have a value
between one and a hundred: `i32`, a thirty-two-bit number, or `u32`, an
unsigned thirty-two-bit number, or `i64`, a sixty-four-bit number or others.
So far, that hasn’t mattered, and so Rust defaults to an `i32`. However, here,
Rust doesn’t know how to compare the `guess` and the `secret_number`. They
need to be the same type. Ultimately, we want to convert the `String` we
read as input into a real number type, for comparison. We can do that
with two more lines. Here’s our new program:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()
        .expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal   => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

The new two lines:

```rust
    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()
        .expect("Please type a number!");
```

Wait a minute, I thought we already had a `guess`? We do, but Rust allows us
to ‘shadow’ the previous `guess` with a new one. This is often used in this
exact situation, where `guess` starts as a `String`, but we want to convert it
to an `u32`. Shadowing lets us re-use the `guess` name, rather than forcing us
to come up with two unique names like `guess_str` and `guess`, or something
else.

We bind `guess` to an expression that looks like something we wrote earlier:

```rust
guess.trim().parse()
```

Here, `guess` refers to the old `guess`, the one that was a `String` with our
input in it. The `trim()` method on `String`s will eliminate any white space at
the beginning and end of our string. This is important, as we had to press the
‘return’ key to satisfy `read_line()`. This means that if we type `5` and hit
return, `guess` looks like this: `5\n`. The `\n` represents ‘newline’, the
enter key. `trim()` gets rid of this, leaving our string with only the `5`. The
[`parse()` method on strings][guessing-game.md--parse] parses a string into some kind of number.
Since it can parse a variety of numbers, we need to give Rust a hint as to the
exact type of number we want. Hence, `let guess: u32`. The colon (`:`) after
`guess` tells Rust we’re going to annotate its type. `u32` is an unsigned,
thirty-two bit integer. Rust has [a number of built-in number types][guessing-game.md--number],
but we’ve chosen `u32`. It’s a good default choice for a small positive number.

[guessing-game.md--parse]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse
[guessing-game.md--number]: #numeric-types

Just like `read_line()`, our call to `parse()` could cause an error. What if
our string contained `A👍%`? There’d be no way to convert that to a number. As
such, we’ll do the same thing we did with `read_line()`: use the `expect()`
method to crash if there’s an error.

Let’s try our program out!

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
     Running `target/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 58
Please input your guess.
  76
You guessed: 76
Too big!
```

Nice! You can see I even added spaces before my guess, and it still figured
out that I guessed 76. Run the program a few times, and verify that guessing
the number works, as well as guessing a number too small.

Now we’ve got most of the game working, but we can only make one guess. Let’s
change that by adding loops!

### Looping

The `loop` keyword gives us an infinite loop. Let’s add that in:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()
            .expect("Please type a number!");

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal   => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }
}
```

And try it out. But wait, didn’t we just add an infinite loop? Yup. Remember
our discussion about `parse()`? If we give a non-number answer, we’ll `panic!`
and quit. Observe:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
     Running `target/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 59
Please input your guess.
45
You guessed: 45
Too small!
Please input your guess.
60
You guessed: 60
Too big!
Please input your guess.
59
You guessed: 59
You win!
Please input your guess.
quit
thread '<main>' panicked at 'Please type a number!'
```

Ha! `quit` actually quits. As does any other non-number input. Well, this is
suboptimal to say the least. First, let’s actually quit when you win the game:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()
            .expect("Please type a number!");

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal   => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By adding the `break` line after the `You win!`, we’ll exit the loop when we
win. Exiting the loop also means exiting the program, since it’s the last
thing in `main()`. We have only one more tweak to make: when someone inputs a
non-number, we don’t want to quit, we want to ignore it. We can do that
like this:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal   => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

These are the lines that changed:

```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};
```
This is how you generally move from ‘crash on error’ to ‘actually handle the
error’, by switching from `expect()` to a `match` statement. A `Result` is
returned by `parse()`, this is an `enum`  like `Ordering`, but in this case,
each variant has some data associated with it: `Ok` is a success, and `Err` is a
failure. Each contains more information: the successfully parsed integer, or an
error type. In this case, we `match` on `Ok(num)`, which sets the name `num` to
the unwrapped `Ok` value (ythe integer), and then we  return it on the
right-hand side. In the `Err` case, we don’t care what kind of error it is, so
we just use the catch all `_` instead of a name. This catches everything that
isn't `Ok`, and `continue` lets us move to the next iteration of the loop; in
effect, this enables us to ignore all errors and continue with our program.

Now we should be good! Let’s try:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)
     Running `target/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 61
Please input your guess.
10
You guessed: 10
Too small!
Please input your guess.
99
You guessed: 99
Too big!
Please input your guess.
foo
Please input your guess.
61
You guessed: 61
You win!
```

Awesome! With one tiny last tweak, we have finished the guessing game. Can you
think of what it is? That’s right, we don’t want to print out the secret
number. It was good for testing, but it kind of ruins the game. Here’s our
final source:

```rust
extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less    => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal   => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Complete!

At this point, you have successfully built the Guessing Game! Congratulations!

This first project showed you a lot: `let`, `match`, methods, associated
functions, using external crates, and more. Our next project will show off
even more.


# Syntax and Semantics {#sec--syntax-and-semantics}


This chapter breaks Rust down into small chunks, one for each concept.

If you’d like to learn Rust from the bottom up, reading this in order is a
great way to do that.

These sections also form a reference for each concept, so if you’re reading
another tutorial and find something confusing, you can find it explained
somewhere in here.


## Variable Bindings {#sec--variable-bindings}


Virtually every non-'Hello World’ Rust program uses *variable bindings*. They
bind some value to a name, so it can be used later. `let` is
used to introduce a binding, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
}
```

Putting `fn main() {` in each example is a bit tedious, so we’ll leave that out
in the future. If you’re following along, make sure to edit your `main()`
function, rather than leaving it off. Otherwise, you’ll get an error.

### Patterns

In many languages, a variable binding would be called a *variable*, but Rust’s
variable bindings have a few tricks up their sleeves. For example the
left-hand side of a `let` expression is a ‘[pattern][variable-bindings.md--pattern]’, not a
variable name. This means we can do things like:

```rust
let (x, y) = (1, 2);
```

After this expression is evaluated, `x` will be one, and `y` will be two.
Patterns are really powerful, and have [their own section][variable-bindings.md--pattern] in the
book. We don’t need those features for now, so we’ll keep this in the back
of our minds as we go forward.

[variable-bindings.md--pattern]: #sec--patterns

### Type annotations

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that we specify our types up
front, and they’re checked at compile time. So why does our first example
compile? Well, Rust has this thing called ‘type inference’. If it can figure
out what the type of something is, Rust doesn’t require you to actually type it
out.

We can add the type if we want to, though. Types come after a colon (`:`):

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
```

If I asked you to read this out loud to the rest of the class, you’d say “`x`
is a binding with the type `i32` and the value `five`.”

In this case we chose to represent `x` as a 32-bit signed integer. Rust has
many different primitive integer types. They begin with `i` for signed integers
and `u` for unsigned integers. The possible integer sizes are 8, 16, 32, and 64
bits.

In future examples, we may annotate the type in a comment. The examples will
look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // x: i32
}
```

Note the similarities between this annotation and the syntax you use with
`let`. Including these kinds of comments is not idiomatic Rust, but we'll
occasionally include them to help you understand what the types that Rust
infers are.

### Mutability

By default, bindings are *immutable*. This code will not compile:

```rust
let x = 5;
x = 10;
```

It will give you this error:

```text
error: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`
     x = 10;
     ^~~~~~~
```

If you want a binding to be mutable, you can use `mut`:

```rust
let mut x = 5; // mut x: i32
x = 10;
```

There is no single reason that bindings are immutable by default, but we can
think about it through one of Rust’s primary focuses: safety. If you forget to
say `mut`, the compiler will catch it, and let you know that you have mutated
something you may not have intended to mutate. If bindings were mutable by
default, the compiler would not be able to tell you this. If you _did_ intend
mutation, then the solution is quite easy: add `mut`.

There are other good reasons to avoid mutable state when possible, but they’re
out of the scope of this guide. In general, you can often avoid explicit
mutation, and so it is preferable in Rust. That said, sometimes, mutation is
what you need, so it’s not verboten.

### Initializing bindings

Rust variable bindings have one more aspect that differs from other languages:
bindings are required to be initialized with a value before you're allowed to
use them.

Let’s try it out. Change your `src/main.rs` file to look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;

    println!("Hello world!");
}
```

You can use `cargo build` on the command line to build it. You’ll get a
warning, but it will still print "Hello, world!":

```text
   Compiling hello_world v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/hello_world)
src/main.rs:2:9: 2:10 warning: unused variable: `x`, #[warn(unused_variable)]
   on by default
src/main.rs:2     let x: i32;
                      ^
```

Rust warns us that we never use the variable binding, but since we never use
it, no harm, no foul. Things change if we try to actually use this `x`,
however. Let’s do that. Change your program to look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

And try to build it. You’ll get an error:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_world v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/hello_world)
src/main.rs:4:39: 4:40 error: use of possibly uninitialized variable: `x`
src/main.rs:4     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
                                                    ^

<std macros>:1:1: 3:2 note: in expansion of println!
src/main.rs:4:5: 4:42 note: expansion site
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `hello_world`.
```

Rust will not let us use a value that has not been initialized. Next, let’s
talk about this stuff we've added to `println!`.

If you include two curly braces (`{}`, some call them moustaches...) in your
string to print, Rust will interpret this as a request to interpolate some sort
of value. *String interpolation* is a computer science term that means "stick
in the middle of a string." We add a comma, and then `x`, to indicate that we
want `x` to be the value we’re interpolating. The comma is used to separate
arguments we pass to functions and macros, if you’re passing more than one.

When you use the curly braces, Rust will attempt to display the value in a
meaningful way by checking out its type. If you want to specify the format in a
more detailed manner, there are a [wide number of options available][variable-bindings.md--format].
For now, we'll stick to the default: integers aren't very complicated to
print.

[variable-bindings.md--format]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html

### Scope and shadowing

Let’s get back to bindings. Variable bindings have a scope - they are
constrained to live in a block they were defined in. A block is a collection
of statements enclosed by `{` and `}`. Function definitions are also blocks!
In the following example we define two variable bindings, `x` and `y`, which
live in different blocks. `x` can be accessed from inside the `fn main() {}`
block, while `y` can be accessed only from inside the inner block:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 17;
    {
        let y: i32 = 3;
        println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y); // This won't work
}
```

The first `println!` would print "The value of x is 17 and the value of y is
3", but this example cannot be compiled successfully, because the second
`println!` cannot access the value of `y`, since it is not in scope anymore.
Instead we get this error:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/hello_world)
main.rs:7:62: 7:63 error: unresolved name `y`. Did you mean `x`? [E0425]

↳ 't work
                                                                       ^

error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `hello`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

Additionally, variable bindings can be shadowed. This means that a later
variable binding with the same name as another binding, that's currently in
scope, will override the previous binding.

```rust
let x: i32 = 8;
{
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "8"
    let x = 12;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "12"
}
println!("{}", x); // Prints "8"
let x =  42;
println!("{}", x); // Prints "42"
```

Shadowing and mutable bindings may appear as two sides of the same coin, but
they are two distinct concepts that can't always be used interchangeably. For
one, shadowing enables us to rebind a name to a value of a different type. It
is also possible to change the mutability of a binding.

```rust
let mut x: i32 = 1;
x = 7;
let x = x; // x is now immutable and is bound to 7

let y = 4;
let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; // y is now of a different type
```


## Functions {#sec--functions}


Every Rust program has at least one function, the `main` function:

```rust
fn main() {
}
```

This is the simplest possible function declaration. As we mentioned before,
`fn` says ‘this is a function’, followed by the name, some parentheses because
this function takes no arguments, and then some curly braces to indicate the
body. Here’s a function named `foo`:

```rust
fn foo() {
}
```

So, what about taking arguments? Here’s a function that prints a number:

```rust
fn print_number(x: i32) {
    println!("x is: {}", x);
}
```

Here’s a complete program that uses `print_number`:

```rust
fn main() {
    print_number(5);
}

fn print_number(x: i32) {
    println!("x is: {}", x);
}
```

As you can see, function arguments work very similar to `let` declarations:
you add a type to the argument name, after a colon.

Here’s a complete program that adds two numbers together and prints them:

```rust
fn main() {
    print_sum(5, 6);
}

fn print_sum(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("sum is: {}", x + y);
}
```

You separate arguments with a comma, both when you call the function, as well
as when you declare it.

Unlike `let`, you _must_ declare the types of function arguments. This does
not work:

```rust
fn print_sum(x, y) {
    println!("sum is: {}", x + y);
}
```

You get this error:

```text
expected one of `!`, `:`, or `@`, found `)`
fn print_sum(x, y) {
```

This is a deliberate design decision. While full-program inference is possible,
languages which have it, like Haskell, often suggest that documenting your
types explicitly is a best-practice. We agree that forcing functions to declare
types while allowing for inference inside of function bodies is a wonderful
sweet spot between full inference and no inference.

What about returning a value? Here’s a function that adds one to an integer:

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Rust functions return exactly one value, and you declare the type after an
‘arrow’, which is a dash (`-`) followed by a greater-than sign (`>`). The last
line of a function determines what it returns. You’ll note the lack of a
semicolon here. If we added it in:

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

We would get an error:

```text
error: not all control paths return a value
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
     x + 1;
}

help: consider removing this semicolon:
     x + 1;
          ^
```

This reveals two interesting things about Rust: it is an expression-based
language, and semicolons are different from semicolons in other ‘curly brace
and semicolon’-based languages. These two things are related.

#### Expressions vs. Statements

Rust is primarily an expression-based language. There are only two kinds of
statements, and everything else is an expression.

So what's the difference? Expressions return a value, and statements do not.
That’s why we end up with ‘not all control paths return a value’ here: the
statement `x + 1;` doesn’t return a value. There are two kinds of statements in
Rust: ‘declaration statements’ and ‘expression statements’. Everything else is
an expression. Let’s talk about declaration statements first.

In some languages, variable bindings can be written as expressions, not
statements. Like Ruby:

```ruby
x = y = 5
```

In Rust, however, using `let` to introduce a binding is _not_ an expression. The
following will produce a compile-time error:

```ignore
let x = (let y = 5); // expected identifier, found keyword `let`
```

The compiler is telling us here that it was expecting to see the beginning of
an expression, and a `let` can only begin a statement, not an expression.

Note that assigning to an already-bound variable (e.g. `y = 5`) is still an
expression, although its value is not particularly useful. Unlike other
languages where an assignment evaluates to the assigned value (e.g. `5` in the
previous example), in Rust the value of an assignment is an empty tuple `()`
because the assigned value can have [only one owner](#sec--ownership), and any
other returned value would be too surprising:

```rust
let mut y = 5;

let x = (y = 6);  // x has the value `()`, not `6`
```

The second kind of statement in Rust is the *expression statement*. Its
purpose is to turn any expression into a statement. In practical terms, Rust's
grammar expects statements to follow other statements. This means that you use
semicolons to separate expressions from each other. This means that Rust
looks a lot like most other languages that require you to use semicolons
at the end of every line, and you will see semicolons at the end of almost
every line of Rust code you see.

What is this exception that makes us say "almost"? You saw it already, in this
code:

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Our function claims to return an `i32`, but with a semicolon, it would return
`()` instead. Rust realizes this probably isn’t what we want, and suggests
removing the semicolon in the error we saw before.

#### Early returns

But what about early returns? Rust does have a keyword for that, `return`:

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) -> i32 {
    return x;

    // we never run this code!
    x + 1
}
```

Using a `return` as the last line of a function works, but is considered poor
style:

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) -> i32 {
    return x + 1;
}
```

The previous definition without `return` may look a bit strange if you haven’t
worked in an expression-based language before, but it becomes intuitive over
time.

#### Diverging functions

Rust has some special syntax for ‘diverging functions’, which are functions that
do not return:

```rust
fn diverges() -> ! {
    panic!("This function never returns!");
}
```

`panic!` is a macro, similar to `println!()` that we’ve already seen. Unlike
`println!()`, `panic!()` causes the current thread of execution to crash with
the given message. Because this function will cause a crash, it will never
return, and so it has the type ‘`!`’, which is read ‘diverges’.

If you add a main function that calls `diverges()` and run it, you’ll get
some output that looks like this:

```text
thread ‘<main>’ panicked at ‘This function never returns!’, hello.rs:2
```

If you want more information, you can get a backtrace by setting the
`RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable:

```text
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./diverges
thread '<main>' panicked at 'This function never returns!', hello.rs:2
stack backtrace:
   1:     0x7f402773a829 - sys::backtrace::write::h0942de78b6c02817K8r

   6:     0x7f40277389e5 - main::h19bb1149c2f00ecfBaa
   7:     0x7f402773f514 - rt::unwind::try::try_fn::h13186883479104382231
   8:     0x7f402773d1d8 - __rust_try

  12:     0x7f40277386c8 - <unknown>
  13:                0x0 - <unknown>
```

`RUST_BACKTRACE` also works with Cargo’s `run` command:

```text
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
     Running `target/debug/diverges`
thread '<main>' panicked at 'This function never returns!', hello.rs:2
stack backtrace:
   1:     0x7f402773a829 - sys::backtrace::write::h0942de78b6c02817K8r
   2:     0x7f402773d7fc - panicking::on_panic::h3f23f9d0b5f4c91bu9w

   5:     0x7f4027738809 - diverges::h2266b4c4b850236beaa
   6:     0x7f40277389e5 - main::h19bb1149c2f00ecfBaa
   7:     0x7f402773f514 - rt::unwind::try::try_fn::h13186883479104382231
   8:     0x7f402773d1d8 - __rust_try
   9:     0x7f402773f201 - rt::lang_start::ha172a3ce74bb453aK5w
  10:     0x7f4027738a19 - main
  11:     0x7f402694ab44 - __libc_start_main
  12:     0x7f40277386c8 - <unknown>
  13:                0x0 - <unknown>
```

A diverging function can be used as any type:

```should_panic
# fn diverges() -> ! {
#    panic!("This function never returns!");
# }
let x: i32 = diverges();
let x: String = diverges();
```

#### Function pointers

We can also create variable bindings which point to functions:

```rust
let f: fn(i32) -> i32;
```

`f` is a variable binding which points to a function that takes an `i32` as
an argument and returns an `i32`. For example:

```rust
fn plus_one(i: i32) -> i32 {
    i + 1
}

// without type inference
let f: fn(i32) -> i32 = plus_one;

// with type inference
let f = plus_one;
```

We can then use `f` to call the function:

```rust
let six = f(5);
```


## Primitive Types {#sec--primitive-types}


The Rust language has a number of types that are considered ‘primitive’. This
means that they’re built-in to the language. Rust is structured in such a way
that the standard library also provides a number of useful types built on top
of these ones, as well, but these are the most primitive.

### Booleans

Rust has a built in boolean type, named `bool`. It has two values, `true` and `false`:

```rust
let x = true;

let y: bool = false;
```

A common use of booleans is in [`if` conditionals][primitive-types.md--if].

[primitive-types.md--if]: #sec--if

You can find more documentation for `bool`s [in the standard library
documentation][primitive-types.md--bool].

[primitive-types.md--bool]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.bool.html

### `char`

The `char` type represents a single Unicode scalar value. You can create `char`s
with a single tick: (`'`)

```rust
let x = 'x';
let two_hearts = '💕';
```

Unlike some other languages, this means that Rust’s `char` is not a single byte,
but four.

You can find more documentation for `char`s [in the standard library
documentation][primitive-types.md--char].

[primitive-types.md--char]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html

### Numeric types

Rust has a variety of numeric types in a few categories: signed and unsigned,
fixed and variable, floating-point and integer.

These types consist of two parts: the category, and the size. For example,
`u16` is an unsigned type with sixteen bits of size. More bits lets you have
bigger numbers.

If a number literal has nothing to cause its type to be inferred, it defaults:

```rust
let x = 42; // x has type i32

let y = 1.0; // y has type f64
```

Here’s a list of the different numeric types, with links to their documentation
in the standard library:

* [i8](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i8.html)
* [i16](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i16.html)
* [i32](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html)
* [i64](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i64.html)
* [u8](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u8.html)
* [u16](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u16.html)
* [u32](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html)
* [u64](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html)
* [isize](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.isize.html)
* [usize](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.usize.html)
* [f32](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html)
* [f64](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html)

Let’s go over them by category:

#### Signed and Unsigned

Integer types come in two varieties: signed and unsigned. To understand the
difference, let’s consider a number with four bits of size. A signed, four-bit
number would let you store numbers from `-8` to `+7`. Signed numbers use
“two’s complement representation”. An unsigned four bit number, since it does
not need to store negatives, can store values from `0` to `+15`.

Unsigned types use a `u` for their category, and signed types use `i`. The `i`
is for ‘integer’. So `u8` is an eight-bit unsigned number, and `i8` is an
eight-bit signed number.

#### Fixed size types

Fixed size types have a specific number of bits in their representation. Valid
bit sizes are `8`, `16`, `32`, and `64`. So, `u32` is an unsigned, 32-bit integer,
and `i64` is a signed, 64-bit integer.

#### Variable sized types

Rust also provides types whose size depends on the size of a pointer of the
underlying machine. These types have ‘size’ as the category, and come in signed
and unsigned varieties. This makes for two types: `isize` and `usize`.

#### Floating-point types

Rust also has two floating point types: `f32` and `f64`. These correspond to
IEEE-754 single and double precision numbers.

### Arrays

Like many programming languages, Rust has list types to represent a sequence of
things. The most basic is the *array*, a fixed-size list of elements of the
same type. By default, arrays are immutable.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3]; // a: [i32; 3]
let mut m = [1, 2, 3]; // m: [i32; 3]
```

Arrays have type `[T; N]`. We’ll talk about this `T` notation [in the generics
section][primitive-types.md--generics]. The `N` is a compile-time constant, for the length of the
array.

There’s a shorthand for initializing each element of an array to the same
value. In this example, each element of `a` will be initialized to `0`:

```rust
let a = [0; 20]; // a: [i32; 20]
```

You can get the number of elements in an array `a` with `a.len()`:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3];

println!("a has {} elements", a.len());
```

You can access a particular element of an array with *subscript notation*:

```rust
let names = ["Graydon", "Brian", "Niko"]; // names: [&str; 3]

println!("The second name is: {}", names[1]);
```

Subscripts start at zero, like in most programming languages, so the first name
is `names[0]` and the second name is `names[1]`. The above example prints
`The second name is: Brian`. If you try to use a subscript that is not in the
array, you will get an error: array access is bounds-checked at run-time. Such
errant access is the source of many bugs in other systems programming
languages.

You can find more documentation for `array`s [in the standard library
documentation][primitive-types.md--array].

[primitive-types.md--array]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html

### Slices

A ‘slice’ is a reference to (or “view” into) another data structure. They are
useful for allowing safe, efficient access to a portion of an array without
copying. For example, you might want to reference only one line of a file read
into memory. By nature, a slice is not created directly, but from an existing
variable binding. Slices have a defined length, can be mutable or immutable.

Internally, slices are represented as a pointer to the beginning of the data 
and a length.

#### Slicing syntax

You can use a combo of `&` and `[]` to create a slice from various things. The
`&` indicates that slices are similar to [references], which we will cover in
detail later in this section. The `[]`s, with a range, let you define the
length of the slice:

[primitive-types.md--references]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

```rust
let a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
let complete = &a[..]; // A slice containing all of the elements in a
let middle = &a[1..4]; // A slice of a: only the elements 1, 2, and 3
```

Slices have type `&[T]`. We’ll talk about that `T` when we cover
[generics][primitive-types.md--generics].

[primitive-types.md--generics]: #sec--generics

You can find more documentation for slices [in the standard library
documentation][primitive-types.md--slice].

[primitive-types.md--slice]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html

### `str`

Rust’s `str` type is the most primitive string type. As an [unsized type][primitive-types.md--dst],
it’s not very useful by itself, but becomes useful when placed behind a
reference, like `&str`. We'll elaborate further when we cover
[Strings][primitive-types.md--strings] and [references].

[primitive-types.md--dst]: #sec--unsized-types
[primitive-types.md--strings]: #sec--strings
[primitive-types.md--references]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

You can find more documentation for `str` [in the standard library
documentation][primitive-types.md--str].

[primitive-types.md--str]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html

### Tuples

A tuple is an ordered list of fixed size. Like this:

```rust
let x = (1, "hello");
```

The parentheses and commas form this two-length tuple. Here’s the same code, but
with the type annotated:

```rust
let x: (i32, &str) = (1, "hello");
```

As you can see, the type of a tuple looks like the tuple, but with each
position having a type name rather than the value. Careful readers will also
note that tuples are heterogeneous: we have an `i32` and a `&str` in this tuple.
In systems programming languages, strings are a bit more complex than in other
languages. For now, read `&str` as a *string slice*, and we’ll learn more
soon.

You can assign one tuple into another, if they have the same contained types
and [arity]. Tuples have the same arity when they have the same length.

[primitive-types.md--arity]: #arity

```rust
let mut x = (1, 2); // x: (i32, i32)
let y = (2, 3); // y: (i32, i32)

x = y;
```

You can access the fields in a tuple through a *destructuring let*. Here’s
an example:

```rust
let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);

println!("x is {}", x);
```

Remember [before][primitive-types.md--let] when I said the left-hand side of a `let` statement was more
powerful than assigning a binding? Here we are. We can put a pattern on
the left-hand side of the `let`, and if it matches up to the right-hand side,
we can assign multiple bindings at once. In this case, `let` “destructures”
or “breaks up” the tuple, and assigns the bits to three bindings.

[primitive-types.md--let]: #sec--variable-bindings

This pattern is very powerful, and we’ll see it repeated more later.

You can disambiguate a single-element tuple from a value in parentheses with a
comma:

```rust
(0,); // single-element tuple
(0); // zero in parentheses
```

#### Tuple Indexing

You can also access fields of a tuple with indexing syntax:


```rust
let tuple = (1, 2, 3);

let x = tuple.0;
let y = tuple.1;
let z = tuple.2;

println!("x is {}", x);
```

Like array indexing, it starts at zero, but unlike array indexing, it uses a
`.`, rather than `[]`s.

You can find more documentation for tuples [in the standard library
documentation][primitive-types.md--tuple].

[primitive-types.md--tuple]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.tuple.html

### Functions

Functions also have a type! They look like this:

```rust
fn foo(x: i32) -> i32 { x }

let x: fn(i32) -> i32 = foo;
```

In this case, `x` is a ‘function pointer’ to a function that takes an `i32` and
returns an `i32`.


## Comments {#sec--comments}


Now that we have some functions, it’s a good idea to learn about comments.
Comments are notes that you leave to other programmers to help explain things
about your code. The compiler mostly ignores them.

Rust has two kinds of comments that you should care about: *line comments*
and *doc comments*.

```rust
// Line comments are anything after ‘//’ and extend to the end of the line.

let x = 5; // this is also a line comment.

// If you have a long explanation for something, you can put line comments next
// to each other. Put a space between the // and your comment so that it’s
// more readable.
```

The other kind of comment is a doc comment. Doc comments use `///` instead of
`//`, and support Markdown notation inside:

```rust
/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5;
///
/// assert_eq!(6, add_one(5));
/// # fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
/// #     x + 1
/// # }
/// ```
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

There is another style of doc comment, `//!`, to comment containing items (e.g.
crates, modules or functions), instead of the items following it. Commonly used
inside crates root (lib.rs) or modules root (mod.rs):

```
//! # The Rust Standard Library
//!
//! The Rust Standard Library provides the essential runtime
//! functionality for building portable Rust software.
```

When writing doc comments, providing some examples of usage is very, very
helpful. You’ll notice we’ve used a new macro here: `assert_eq!`. This compares
two values, and `panic!`s if they’re not equal to each other. It’s very helpful
in documentation. There’s another macro, `assert!`, which `panic!`s if the
value passed to it is `false`.

You can use the [`rustdoc`](#sec--documentation) tool to generate HTML documentation
from these doc comments, and also to run the code examples as tests!


## if {#sec--if}


Rust’s take on `if` is not particularly complex, but it’s much more like the
`if` you’ll find in a dynamically typed language than in a more traditional
systems language. So let’s talk about it, to make sure you grasp the nuances.

`if` is a specific form of a more general concept, the ‘branch’. The name comes
from a branch in a tree: a decision point, where depending on a choice,
multiple paths can be taken.

In the case of `if`, there is one choice that leads down two paths:

```rust
let x = 5;

if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
}
```

If we changed the value of `x` to something else, this line would not print.
More specifically, if the expression after the `if` evaluates to `true`, then
the block is executed. If it’s `false`, then it is not.

If you want something to happen in the `false` case, use an `else`:

```rust
let x = 5;

if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
} else {
    println!("x is not five :(");
}
```

If there is more than one case, use an `else if`:

```rust
let x = 5;

if x == 5 {
    println!("x is five!");
} else if x == 6 {
    println!("x is six!");
} else {
    println!("x is not five or six :(");
}
```

This is all pretty standard. However, you can also do this:

```rust
let x = 5;

let y = if x == 5 {
    10
} else {
    15
}; // y: i32
```

Which we can (and probably should) write like this:

```rust
let x = 5;

let y = if x == 5 { 10 } else { 15 }; // y: i32
```

This works because `if` is an expression. The value of the expression is the
value of the last expression in whichever branch was chosen. An `if` without an
`else` always results in `()` as the value.


## Loops {#sec--loops}


Rust currently provides three approaches to performing some kind of iterative activity. They are: `loop`, `while` and `for`. Each approach has its own set of uses.

#### loop

The infinite `loop` is the simplest form of loop available in Rust. Using the keyword `loop`, Rust provides a way to loop indefinitely until some terminating statement is reached. Rust's infinite `loop`s look like this:

```rust
loop {
    println!("Loop forever!");
}
```

#### while

Rust also has a `while` loop. It looks like this:

```rust
let mut x = 5; // mut x: i32
let mut done = false; // mut done: bool

while !done {
    x += x - 3;

    println!("{}", x);

    if x % 5 == 0 {
        done = true;
    }
}
```

`while` loops are the correct choice when you’re not sure how many times
you need to loop.

If you need an infinite loop, you may be tempted to write this:

```rust
while true {
```

However, `loop` is far better suited to handle this case:

```rust
loop {
```

Rust’s control-flow analysis treats this construct differently than a `while
true`, since we know that it will always loop. In general, the more information
we can give to the compiler, the better it can do with safety and code
generation, so you should always prefer `loop` when you plan to loop
infinitely.

#### for

The `for` loop is used to loop a particular number of times. Rust’s `for` loops
work a bit differently than in other systems languages, however. Rust’s `for`
loop doesn’t look like this “C-style” `for` loop:

```c
for (x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
    printf( "%d\n", x );
}
```

Instead, it looks like this:

```rust
for x in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", x); // x: i32
}
```

In slightly more abstract terms,

```ignore
for var in expression {
    code
}
```

The expression is an item that can be converted into an [iterator] using
[`IntoIterator`]. The iterator gives back a series of elements. Each element is
one iteration of the loop. That value is then bound to the name `var`, which is
valid for the loop body. Once the body is over, the next value is fetched from
the iterator, and we loop another time. When there are no more values, the `for`
loop is over.

[loops.md--iterator]: #sec--iterators
[loops.md--`IntoIterator`]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html

In our example, `0..10` is an expression that takes a start and an end position,
and gives an iterator over those values. The upper bound is exclusive, though,
so our loop will print `0` through `9`, not `10`.

Rust does not have the “C-style” `for` loop on purpose. Manually controlling
each element of the loop is complicated and error prone, even for experienced C
developers.

##### Enumerate

When you need to keep track of how many times you already looped, you can use the `.enumerate()` function.

###### On ranges:

```rust
for (i,j) in (5..10).enumerate() {
    println!("i = {} and j = {}", i, j);
}
```

Outputs:

```text
i = 0 and j = 5
i = 1 and j = 6
i = 2 and j = 7
i = 3 and j = 8
i = 4 and j = 9
```

Don't forget to add the parentheses around the range.

###### On iterators:

```rust
let lines = "hello\nworld".lines();

for (linenumber, line) in lines.enumerate() {
    println!("{}: {}", linenumber, line);
}
```

Outputs:

```text
0: hello
1: world
```

#### Ending iteration early

Let’s take a look at that `while` loop we had earlier:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let mut done = false;

while !done {
    x += x - 3;

    println!("{}", x);

    if x % 5 == 0 {
        done = true;
    }
}
```

We had to keep a dedicated `mut` boolean variable binding, `done`, to know
when we should exit out of the loop. Rust has two keywords to help us with
modifying iteration: `break` and `continue`.

In this case, we can write the loop in a better way with `break`:

```rust
let mut x = 5;

loop {
    x += x - 3;

    println!("{}", x);

    if x % 5 == 0 { break; }
}
```

We now loop forever with `loop` and use `break` to break out early. Issuing an explicit `return` statement will also serve to terminate the loop early.

`continue` is similar, but instead of ending the loop, goes to the next
iteration. This will only print the odd numbers:

```rust
for x in 0..10 {
    if x % 2 == 0 { continue; }

    println!("{}", x);
}
```

#### Loop labels

You may also encounter situations where you have nested loops and need to
specify which one your `break` or `continue` statement is for. Like most
other languages, by default a `break` or `continue` will apply to innermost
loop. In a situation where you would like to `break` or `continue` for one
of the outer loops, you can use labels to specify which loop the `break` or
 `continue` statement applies to. This will only print when both `x` and `y` are
 odd:

```rust
'outer: for x in 0..10 {
    'inner: for y in 0..10 {
        if x % 2 == 0 { continue 'outer; } // continues the loop over x
        if y % 2 == 0 { continue 'inner; } // continues the loop over y
        println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
    }
}
```


## Ownership {#sec--ownership}


This guide is one of three presenting Rust’s ownership system. This is one of
Rust’s most unique and compelling features, with which Rust developers should
become quite acquainted. Ownership is how Rust achieves its largest goal,
memory safety. There are a few distinct concepts, each with its own
chapter:

* ownership, which you’re reading now
* [borrowing][ownership.md--borrowing], and their associated feature ‘references’
* [lifetimes][ownership.md--lifetimes], an advanced concept of borrowing

These three chapters are related, and in order. You’ll need all three to fully
understand the ownership system.

[ownership.md--borrowing]: #sec--references-and-borrowing
[ownership.md--lifetimes]: #sec--lifetimes

### Meta

Before we get to the details, two important notes about the ownership system.

Rust has a focus on safety and speed. It accomplishes these goals through many
‘zero-cost abstractions’, which means that in Rust, abstractions cost as little
as possible in order to make them work. The ownership system is a prime example
of a zero-cost abstraction. All of the analysis we’ll talk about in this guide
is _done at compile time_. You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these
features.

However, this system does have a certain cost: learning curve. Many new users
to Rust experience something we like to call ‘fighting with the borrow
checker’, where the Rust compiler refuses to compile a program that the author
thinks is valid. This often happens because the programmer’s mental model of
how ownership should work doesn’t match the actual rules that Rust implements.
You probably will experience similar things at first. There is good news,
however: more experienced Rust developers report that once they work with the
rules of the ownership system for a period of time, they fight the borrow
checker less and less.

With that in mind, let’s learn about ownership.

### Ownership

[Variable bindings][ownership.md--bindings] have a property in Rust: they ‘have ownership’
of what they’re bound to. This means that when a binding goes out of scope,
Rust will free the bound resources. For example:

```rust
fn foo() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
}
```

When `v` comes into scope, a new [vector] is created on [the stack][ownership.md--stack],
and it allocates space on [the heap][ownership.md--heap] for its elements. When `v` goes out
of scope at the end of `foo()`, Rust will clean up everything related to the
vector, even the heap-allocated memory. This happens deterministically, at the
end of the scope.

We'll cover [vectors] in detail later in this chapter; we only use them
here as an example of a type that allocates space on the heap at runtime. They
behave like [arrays], except their size may change by `push()`ing more
elements onto them.

Vectors have a [generic type][ownership.md--generics] `Vec<T>`, so in this example `v` will have type
`Vec<i32>`. We'll cover generics in detail later in this chapter.

[ownership.md--arrays]: #arrays
[ownership.md--vectors]: #sec--vectors
[ownership.md--heap]: #sec--the-stack-and-the-heap
[ownership.md--stack]: #the-stack
[ownership.md--bindings]: #sec--variable-bindings
[ownership.md--generics]: #sec--generics

### Move semantics

There’s some more subtlety here, though: Rust ensures that there is _exactly
one_ binding to any given resource. For example, if we have a vector, we can
assign it to another binding:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v2 = v;
```

But, if we try to use `v` afterwards, we get an error:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v2 = v;

println!("v[0] is: {}", v[0]);
```

It looks like this:

```text
error: use of moved value: `v`
println!("v[0] is: {}", v[0]);
                        ^
```

A similar thing happens if we define a function which takes ownership, and
try to use something after we’ve passed it as an argument:

```rust
fn take(v: Vec<i32>) {
    // what happens here isn’t important.
}

let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

take(v);

println!("v[0] is: {}", v[0]);
```

Same error: ‘use of moved value’. When we transfer ownership to something else,
we say that we’ve ‘moved’ the thing we refer to. You don’t need some sort of
special annotation here, it’s the default thing that Rust does.

#### The details

The reason that we cannot use a binding after we’ve moved it is subtle, but
important. 

When we write code like this:

```rust
let x = 10;
```

Rust allocates memory for an integer [i32] on the [stack][ownership.md--sh], copies the bit
pattern representing the value of 10 to the allocated memory and binds the
variable name x to this memory region for future reference.

Now consider the following code fragment:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

let mut v2 = v;
```

The first line allocates memory for the vector object `v` on the stack like
it does for `x` above. But in addition to that it also allocates some memory
on the [heap][ownership.md--sh] for the actual data (`[1, 2, 3]`). Rust copies the address
of this heap allocation to an internal pointer, which is part of the vector
object placed on the stack (let's call it the data pointer). 

It is worth pointing out (even at the risk of stating the obvious) that the
vector object and its data live in separate memory regions instead of being a
single contiguous memory allocation (due to reasons we will not go into at
this point of time). These two parts of the vector (the one on the stack and
one on the heap) must agree with each other at all times with regards to
things like the length, capacity etc.

When we move `v` to `v2`, Rust actually does a bitwise copy of the vector
object `v` into the stack allocation represented by `v2`. This shallow copy
does not create a copy of the heap allocation containing the actual data.
Which means that there would be two pointers to the contents of the vector
both pointing to the same memory allocation on the heap. It would violate
Rust’s safety guarantees by introducing a data race if one could access both
`v` and `v2` at the same time. 

For example if we truncated the vector to just two elements through `v2`:

```rust
v2.truncate(2);
```

and `v1` were still accessible we'd end up with an invalid vector since `v1`
would not know that the heap data has been truncated. Now, the part of the
vector `v1` on the stack does not agree with the corresponding part on the
heap. `v1` still thinks there are three elements in the vector and will
happily let us access the non existent element `v1[2]` but as you might
already know this is a recipe for disaster. Especially because it might lead
to a segmentation fault or worse allow an unauthorized user to read from
memory to which they don't have access.

This is why Rust forbids using `v` after we’ve done the move.

[ownership.md--sh]: #sec--the-stack-and-the-heap

It’s also important to note that optimizations may remove the actual copy of
the bytes on the stack, depending on circumstances. So it may not be as
inefficient as it initially seems.

#### `Copy` types

We’ve established that when ownership is transferred to another binding, you
cannot use the original binding. However, there’s a [trait][ownership.md--traits] that changes this
behavior, and it’s called `Copy`. We haven’t discussed traits yet, but for now,
you can think of them as an annotation to a particular type that adds extra
behavior. For example:

```rust
let v = 1;

let v2 = v;

println!("v is: {}", v);
```

In this case, `v` is an `i32`, which implements the `Copy` trait. This means
that, just like a move, when we assign `v` to `v2`, a copy of the data is made.
But, unlike a move, we can still use `v` afterward. This is because an `i32`
has no pointers to data somewhere else, copying it is a full copy.

All primitive types implement the `Copy` trait and their ownership is
therefore not moved like one would assume, following the ´ownership rules´.
To give an example, the two following snippets of code only compile because the
`i32` and `bool` types implement the `Copy` trait.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 5;

    let _y = double(a);
    println!("{}", a);
}

fn double(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x * 2
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = true;

    let _y = change_truth(a);
    println!("{}", a);
}

fn change_truth(x: bool) -> bool {
    !x
}
```

If we had used types that do not implement the `Copy` trait,
we would have gotten a compile error because we tried to use a moved value.

```text
error: use of moved value: `a`
println!("{}", a);
               ^
```

We will discuss how to make your own types `Copy` in the [traits][ownership.md--traits]
section.

[ownership.md--traits]: #sec--traits

### More than ownership

Of course, if we had to hand ownership back with every function we wrote:

```rust
fn foo(v: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // do stuff with v

    // hand back ownership
    v
}
```

This would get very tedious. It gets worse the more things we want to take ownership of:

```rust
fn foo(v1: Vec<i32>, v2: Vec<i32>) -> (Vec<i32>, Vec<i32>, i32) {
    // do stuff with v1 and v2

    // hand back ownership, and the result of our function
    (v1, v2, 42)
}

let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v2 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let (v1, v2, answer) = foo(v1, v2);
```

Ugh! The return type, return line, and calling the function gets way more
complicated.

Luckily, Rust offers a feature, borrowing, which helps us solve this problem.
It’s the topic of the next section!



## References and Borrowing {#sec--references-and-borrowing}


This guide is two of three presenting Rust’s ownership system. This is one of
Rust’s most unique and compelling features, with which Rust developers should
become quite acquainted. Ownership is how Rust achieves its largest goal,
memory safety. There are a few distinct concepts, each with its own
chapter:

* [ownership][references-and-borrowing.md--ownership], the key concept
* borrowing, which you’re reading now
* [lifetimes][references-and-borrowing.md--lifetimes], an advanced concept of borrowing

These three chapters are related, and in order. You’ll need all three to fully
understand the ownership system.

[references-and-borrowing.md--ownership]: #sec--ownership
[references-and-borrowing.md--lifetimes]: #sec--lifetimes

### Meta

Before we get to the details, two important notes about the ownership system.

Rust has a focus on safety and speed. It accomplishes these goals through many
‘zero-cost abstractions’, which means that in Rust, abstractions cost as little
as possible in order to make them work. The ownership system is a prime example
of a zero cost abstraction. All of the analysis we’ll talk about in this guide
is _done at compile time_. You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these
features.

However, this system does have a certain cost: learning curve. Many new users
to Rust experience something we like to call ‘fighting with the borrow
checker’, where the Rust compiler refuses to compile a program that the author
thinks is valid. This often happens because the programmer’s mental model of
how ownership should work doesn’t match the actual rules that Rust implements.
You probably will experience similar things at first. There is good news,
however: more experienced Rust developers report that once they work with the
rules of the ownership system for a period of time, they fight the borrow
checker less and less.

With that in mind, let’s learn about borrowing.

### Borrowing

At the end of the [ownership][references-and-borrowing.md--ownership] section, we had a nasty function that looked
like this:

```rust
fn foo(v1: Vec<i32>, v2: Vec<i32>) -> (Vec<i32>, Vec<i32>, i32) {
    // do stuff with v1 and v2

    // hand back ownership, and the result of our function
    (v1, v2, 42)
}

let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v2 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let (v1, v2, answer) = foo(v1, v2);
```

This is not idiomatic Rust, however, as it doesn’t take advantage of borrowing. Here’s
the first step:

```rust
fn foo(v1: &Vec<i32>, v2: &Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    // do stuff with v1 and v2

    // return the answer
    42
}

let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v2 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let answer = foo(&v1, &v2);

// we can use v1 and v2 here!
```

Instead of taking `Vec<i32>`s as our arguments, we take a reference:
`&Vec<i32>`. And instead of passing `v1` and `v2` directly, we pass `&v1` and
`&v2`. We call the `&T` type a ‘reference’, and rather than owning the resource,
it borrows ownership. A binding that borrows something does not deallocate the
resource when it goes out of scope. This means that after the call to `foo()`,
we can use our original bindings again.

References are immutable, like bindings. This means that inside of `foo()`,
the vectors can’t be changed at all:

```rust
fn foo(v: &Vec<i32>) {
     v.push(5);
}

let v = vec![];

foo(&v);
```

errors with:

```text
error: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*v` as mutable
v.push(5);
^
```

Pushing a value mutates the vector, and so we aren’t allowed to do it.

### &mut references

There’s a second kind of reference: `&mut T`. A ‘mutable reference’ allows you
to mutate the resource you’re borrowing. For example:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
{
    let y = &mut x;
    *y += 1;
}
println!("{}", x);
```

This will print `6`. We make `y` a mutable reference to `x`, then add one to
the thing `y` points at. You’ll notice that `x` had to be marked `mut` as well.
If it wasn’t, we couldn’t take a mutable borrow to an immutable value.

You'll also notice we added an asterisk (`*`) in front of `y`, making it `*y`,
this is because `y` is a `&mut` reference. You'll also need to use them for
accessing the contents of a reference as well.

Otherwise, `&mut` references are like references. There _is_ a large
difference between the two, and how they interact, though. You can tell
something is fishy in the above example, because we need that extra scope, with
the `{` and `}`. If we remove them, we get an error:

```text
error: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
    println!("{}", x);
                   ^
note: previous borrow of `x` occurs here; the mutable borrow prevents
subsequent moves, borrows, or modification of `x` until the borrow ends
        let y = &mut x;
                     ^
note: previous borrow ends here
fn main() {

}
^
```

As it turns out, there are rules.

### The Rules

Here’s the rules about borrowing in Rust:

First, any borrow must last for a scope no greater than that of the owner.
Second, you may have one or the other of these two kinds of borrows, but not
both at the same time:

* one or more references (`&T`) to a resource,
* exactly one mutable reference (`&mut T`).


You may notice that this is very similar, though not exactly the same as,
to the definition of a data race:

> There is a ‘data race’ when two or more pointers access the same memory
> location at the same time, where at least one of them is writing, and the
> operations are not synchronized.

With references, you may have as many as you’d like, since none of them are
writing. However, as we can only have one `&mut` at a time, it is impossible to
have a data race. This is how Rust prevents data races at compile time: we’ll
get errors if we break the rules.

With this in mind, let’s consider our example again.

#### Thinking in scopes

Here’s the code:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &mut x;

*y += 1;

println!("{}", x);
```

This code gives us this error:

```text
error: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
    println!("{}", x);
                   ^
```

This is because we’ve violated the rules: we have a `&mut T` pointing to `x`,
and so we aren’t allowed to create any `&T`s. One or the other. The note
hints at how to think about this problem:

```text
note: previous borrow ends here
fn main() {

}
^
```

In other words, the mutable borrow is held through the rest of our example. What
we want is for the mutable borrow to end _before_ we try to call `println!` and
make an immutable borrow. In Rust, borrowing is tied to the scope that the
borrow is valid for. And our scopes look like this:

```rust
let mut x = 5;

let y = &mut x;    // -+ &mut borrow of x starts here
                   //  |
*y += 1;           //  |
                   //  |
println!("{}", x); // -+ - try to borrow x here
                   // -+ &mut borrow of x ends here
```

The scopes conflict: we can’t make an `&x` while `y` is in scope.

So when we add the curly braces:

```rust
let mut x = 5;

{
    let y = &mut x; // -+ &mut borrow starts here
    *y += 1;        //  |
}                   // -+ ... and ends here

println!("{}", x);  // <- try to borrow x here
```

There’s no problem. Our mutable borrow goes out of scope before we create an
immutable one. But scope is the key to seeing how long a borrow lasts for.

#### Issues borrowing prevents

Why have these restrictive rules? Well, as we noted, these rules prevent data
races. What kinds of issues do data races cause? Here’s a few.

##### Iterator invalidation

One example is ‘iterator invalidation’, which happens when you try to mutate a
collection that you’re iterating over. Rust’s borrow checker prevents this from
happening:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];

for i in &v {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

This prints out one through three. As we iterate through the vector, we’re
only given references to the elements. And `v` is itself borrowed as immutable,
which means we can’t change it while we’re iterating:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];

for i in &v {
    println!("{}", i);
    v.push(34);
}
```

Here’s the error:

```text
error: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    v.push(34);
    ^
note: previous borrow of `v` occurs here; the immutable borrow prevents
subsequent moves or mutable borrows of `v` until the borrow ends
for i in &v {
          ^
note: previous borrow ends here
for i in &v {
    println!(“{}”, i);
    v.push(34);
}
^
```

We can’t modify `v` because it’s borrowed by the loop.

##### use after free

References must not live longer than the resource they refer to. Rust will
check the scopes of your references to ensure that this is true.

If Rust didn’t check this property, we could accidentally use a reference
which was invalid. For example:

```rust
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x;
}

println!("{}", y);
```

We get this error:

```text
error: `x` does not live long enough
    y = &x;
         ^
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement 0 at
2:16...
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x;
}

note: ...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix following
statement 0 at 4:18
    let x = 5;
    y = &x;
}
```

In other words, `y` is only valid for the scope where `x` exists. As soon as
`x` goes away, it becomes invalid to refer to it. As such, the error says that
the borrow ‘doesn’t live long enough’ because it’s not valid for the right
amount of time.

The same problem occurs when the reference is declared _before_ the variable it
refers to. This is because resources within the same scope are freed in the
opposite order they were declared:

```rust
let y: &i32;
let x = 5;
y = &x;

println!("{}", y);
```

We get this error:

```text
error: `x` does not live long enough
y = &x;
     ^
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement 0 at
2:16...
    let y: &i32;
    let x = 5;
    y = &x;

    println!("{}", y);
}

note: ...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix following
statement 1 at 3:14
    let x = 5;
    y = &x;

    println!("{}", y);
}
```

In the above example, `y` is declared before `x`, meaning that `y` lives longer
than `x`, which is not allowed.



## Lifetimes {#sec--lifetimes}


This guide is three of three presenting Rust’s ownership system. This is one of
Rust’s most unique and compelling features, with which Rust developers should
become quite acquainted. Ownership is how Rust achieves its largest goal,
memory safety. There are a few distinct concepts, each with its own chapter:

* [ownership][lifetimes.md--ownership], the key concept
* [borrowing][lifetimes.md--borrowing], and their associated feature ‘references’
* lifetimes, which you’re reading now

These three chapters are related, and in order. You’ll need all three to fully
understand the ownership system.

[lifetimes.md--ownership]: #sec--ownership
[lifetimes.md--borrowing]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

### Meta

Before we get to the details, two important notes about the ownership system.

Rust has a focus on safety and speed. It accomplishes these goals through many
‘zero-cost abstractions’, which means that in Rust, abstractions cost as little
as possible in order to make them work. The ownership system is a prime example
of a zero-cost abstraction. All of the analysis we’ll talk about in this guide
is _done at compile time_. You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these
features.

However, this system does have a certain cost: learning curve. Many new users
to Rust experience something we like to call ‘fighting with the borrow
checker’, where the Rust compiler refuses to compile a program that the author
thinks is valid. This often happens because the programmer’s mental model of
how ownership should work doesn’t match the actual rules that Rust implements.
You probably will experience similar things at first. There is good news,
however: more experienced Rust developers report that once they work with the
rules of the ownership system for a period of time, they fight the borrow
checker less and less.

With that in mind, let’s learn about lifetimes.

### Lifetimes

Lending out a reference to a resource that someone else owns can be
complicated. For example, imagine this set of operations:

1. I acquire a handle to some kind of resource.
2. I lend you a reference to the resource.
3. I decide I’m done with the resource, and deallocate it, while you still have
  your reference.
4. You decide to use the resource.

Uh oh! Your reference is pointing to an invalid resource. This is called a
dangling pointer or ‘use after free’, when the resource is memory.

To fix this, we have to make sure that step four never happens after step
three. The ownership system in Rust does this through a concept called
lifetimes, which describe the scope that a reference is valid for.

When we have a function that takes a reference by argument, we can be implicit
or explicit about the lifetime of the reference:

```rust
// implicit
fn foo(x: &i32) {
}

// explicit
fn bar<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
}
```

The `'a` reads ‘the lifetime a’. Technically, every reference has some lifetime
associated with it, but the compiler lets you elide (i.e. omit, see
["Lifetime Elision"][lifetimes.md--lifetime-elision] below) them in common cases.
Before we get to that, though, let’s break the explicit example down:

[lifetimes.md--lifetime-elision]: #lifetime-elision

```rust
fn bar<'a>(...)
```

We previously talked a little about [function syntax][lifetimes.md--functions], but we didn’t
discuss the `<>`s after a function’s name. A function can have ‘generic
parameters’ between the `<>`s, of which lifetimes are one kind. We’ll discuss
other kinds of generics [later in the book][lifetimes.md--generics], but for now, let’s
focus on the lifetimes aspect.

[lifetimes.md--functions]: #sec--functions
[lifetimes.md--generics]: #sec--generics

We use `<>` to declare our lifetimes. This says that `bar` has one lifetime,
`'a`. If we had two reference parameters, it would look like this:


```rust
fn bar<'a, 'b>(...)
```

Then in our parameter list, we use the lifetimes we’ve named:

```rust
...(x: &'a i32)
```

If we wanted a `&mut` reference, we’d do this:

```rust
...(x: &'a mut i32)
```

If you compare `&mut i32` to `&'a mut i32`, they’re the same, it’s that
the lifetime `'a` has snuck in between the `&` and the `mut i32`. We read `&mut
i32` as ‘a mutable reference to an `i32`’ and `&'a mut i32` as ‘a mutable
reference to an `i32` with the lifetime `'a`’.

### In `struct`s

You’ll also need explicit lifetimes when working with [`struct`][lifetimes.md--structs]s that
contain references:

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let y = &5; // this is the same as `let _y = 5; let y = &_y;`
    let f = Foo { x: y };

    println!("{}", f.x);
}
```

[lifetimes.md--structs]: #sec--structs

As you can see, `struct`s can also have lifetimes. In a similar way to functions,

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
```

declares a lifetime, and

```rust
x: &'a i32,
```

uses it. So why do we need a lifetime here? We need to ensure that any reference
to a `Foo` cannot outlive the reference to an `i32` it contains.

#### `impl` blocks

Let’s implement a method on `Foo`:

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    fn x(&self) -> &'a i32 { self.x }
}

fn main() {
    let y = &5; // this is the same as `let _y = 5; let y = &_y;`
    let f = Foo { x: y };

    println!("x is: {}", f.x());
}
```

As you can see, we need to declare a lifetime for `Foo` in the `impl` line. We repeat
`'a` twice, like on functions: `impl<'a>` defines a lifetime `'a`, and `Foo<'a>`
uses it.

#### Multiple lifetimes

If you have multiple references, you can use the same lifetime multiple times:

```rust
fn x_or_y<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
```

This says that `x` and `y` both are alive for the same scope, and that the
return value is also alive for that scope. If you wanted `x` and `y` to have
different lifetimes, you can use multiple lifetime parameters:

```rust
fn x_or_y<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &'a str {
```

In this example, `x` and `y` have different valid scopes, but the return value
has the same lifetime as `x`.

#### Thinking in scopes

A way to think about lifetimes is to visualize the scope that a reference is
valid for. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = &5;     // -+ y goes into scope
                    //  |
    // stuff        //  |
                    //  |
}                   // -+ y goes out of scope
```

Adding in our `Foo`:

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let y = &5;           // -+ y goes into scope
    let f = Foo { x: y }; // -+ f goes into scope
    // stuff              //  |
                          //  |
}                         // -+ f and y go out of scope
```

Our `f` lives within the scope of `y`, so everything works. What if it didn’t?
This code won’t work:

```rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

fn main() {
    let x;                    // -+ x goes into scope
                              //  |
    {                         //  |
        let y = &5;           // ---+ y goes into scope
        let f = Foo { x: y }; // ---+ f goes into scope
        x = &f.x;             //  | | error here
    }                         // ---+ f and y go out of scope
                              //  |
    println!("{}", x);        //  |
}                             // -+ x goes out of scope
```

Whew! As you can see here, the scopes of `f` and `y` are smaller than the scope
of `x`. But when we do `x = &f.x`, we make `x` a reference to something that’s
about to go out of scope.

Named lifetimes are a way of giving these scopes a name. Giving something a
name is the first step towards being able to talk about it.

#### 'static

The lifetime named ‘static’ is a special lifetime. It signals that something
has the lifetime of the entire program. Most Rust programmers first come across
`'static` when dealing with strings:

```rust
let x: &'static str = "Hello, world.";
```

String literals have the type `&'static str` because the reference is always
alive: they are baked into the data segment of the final binary. Another
example are globals:

```rust
static FOO: i32 = 5;
let x: &'static i32 = &FOO;
```

This adds an `i32` to the data segment of the binary, and `x` is a reference
to it.

#### Lifetime Elision

Rust supports powerful local type inference in function bodies, but it’s
forbidden in item signatures to allow reasoning about the types based on
the item signature alone. However, for ergonomic reasons a very restricted
secondary inference algorithm called “lifetime elision” applies in function
signatures. It infers only based on the signature components themselves and not
based on the body of the function, only infers lifetime parameters, and does
this with only three easily memorizable and unambiguous rules. This makes
lifetime elision a shorthand for writing an item signature, while not hiding
away the actual types involved as full local inference would if applied to it.

When talking about lifetime elision, we use the term *input lifetime* and
*output lifetime*. An *input lifetime* is a lifetime associated with a parameter
of a function, and an *output lifetime* is a lifetime associated with the return
value of a function. For example, this function has an input lifetime:

```rust
fn foo<'a>(bar: &'a str)
```

This one has an output lifetime:

```rust
fn foo<'a>() -> &'a str
```

This one has a lifetime in both positions:

```rust
fn foo<'a>(bar: &'a str) -> &'a str
```

Here are the three rules:

* Each elided lifetime in a function’s arguments becomes a distinct lifetime
  parameter.

* If there is exactly one input lifetime, elided or not, that lifetime is
  assigned to all elided lifetimes in the return values of that function.

* If there are multiple input lifetimes, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut
  self`, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.

Otherwise, it is an error to elide an output lifetime.

##### Examples

Here are some examples of functions with elided lifetimes.  We’ve paired each
example of an elided lifetime with its expanded form.

```rust
fn print(s: &str); // elided
fn print<'a>(s: &'a str); // expanded

fn debug(lvl: u32, s: &str); // elided
fn debug<'a>(lvl: u32, s: &'a str); // expanded

// In the preceding example, `lvl` doesn’t need a lifetime because it’s not a
// reference (`&`). Only things relating to references (such as a `struct`
// which contains a reference) need lifetimes.

fn substr(s: &str, until: u32) -> &str; // elided
fn substr<'a>(s: &'a str, until: u32) -> &'a str; // expanded

fn get_str() -> &str; // ILLEGAL, no inputs

fn frob(s: &str, t: &str) -> &str; // ILLEGAL, two inputs
fn frob<'a, 'b>(s: &'a str, t: &'b str) -> &str; // Expanded: Output lifetime is ambig
↳ uous

fn get_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T; // elided
fn get_mut<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut T; // expanded

fn args<T: ToCStr>(&mut self, args: &[T]) -> &mut Command; // elided
fn args<'a, 'b, T: ToCStr>(&'a mut self, args: &'b [T]) -> &'a mut Command; // expande
↳ d

fn new(buf: &mut [u8]) -> BufWriter; // elided
fn new<'a>(buf: &'a mut [u8]) -> BufWriter<'a>; // expanded
```


## Mutability {#sec--mutability}


Mutability, the ability to change something, works a bit differently in Rust
than in other languages. The first aspect of mutability is its non-default
status:

```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6; // error!
```

We can introduce mutability with the `mut` keyword:

```rust
let mut x = 5;

x = 6; // no problem!
```

This is a mutable [variable binding][mutability.md--vb]. When a binding is mutable, it means
you’re allowed to change what the binding points to. So in the above example,
it’s not so much that the value at `x` is changing, but that the binding
changed from one `i32` to another.

[mutability.md--vb]: #sec--variable-bindings

If you want to change what the binding points to, you’ll need a [mutable reference][mutability.md--mr]:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &mut x;
```

[mutability.md--mr]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

`y` is an immutable binding to a mutable reference, which means that you can’t
bind `y` to something else (`y = &mut z`), but you can mutate the thing that’s
bound to `y` (`*y = 5`). A subtle distinction.

Of course, if you need both:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let mut y = &mut x;
```

Now `y` can be bound to another value, and the value it’s referencing can be
changed.

It’s important to note that `mut` is part of a [pattern][mutability.md--pattern], so you
can do things like this:

```rust
let (mut x, y) = (5, 6);

fn foo(mut x: i32) {
```

[mutability.md--pattern]: #sec--patterns

### Interior vs. Exterior Mutability

However, when we say something is ‘immutable’ in Rust, that doesn’t mean that
it’s not able to be changed: we mean something has ‘exterior mutability’. Consider,
for example, [`Arc<T>`][mutability.md--arc]:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

let x = Arc::new(5);
let y = x.clone();
```

[mutability.md--arc]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html

When we call `clone()`, the `Arc<T>` needs to update the reference count. Yet
we’ve not used any `mut`s here, `x` is an immutable binding, and we didn’t take
`&mut 5` or anything. So what gives?

To understand this, we have to go back to the core of Rust’s guiding
philosophy, memory safety, and the mechanism by which Rust guarantees it, the
[ownership][mutability.md--ownership] system, and more specifically, [borrowing][mutability.md--borrowing]:

> You may have one or the other of these two kinds of borrows, but not both at
> the same time:
>
> * one or more references (`&T`) to a resource,
> * exactly one mutable reference (`&mut T`).

[mutability.md--ownership]: #sec--ownership
[mutability.md--borrowing]: #borrowing

So, that’s the real definition of ‘immutability’: is this safe to have two
pointers to? In `Arc<T>`’s case, yes: the mutation is entirely contained inside
the structure itself. It’s not user facing. For this reason, it hands out `&T`
with `clone()`. If it handed out `&mut T`s, though, that would be a problem.

Other types, like the ones in the [`std::cell`][mutability.md--stdcell] module, have the
opposite: interior mutability. For example:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let x = RefCell::new(42);

let y = x.borrow_mut();
```

[mutability.md--stdcell]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/index.html

RefCell hands out `&mut` references to what’s inside of it with the
`borrow_mut()` method. Isn’t that dangerous? What if we do:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let x = RefCell::new(42);

let y = x.borrow_mut();
let z = x.borrow_mut();
```

This will in fact panic, at runtime. This is what `RefCell` does: it enforces
Rust’s borrowing rules at runtime, and `panic!`s if they’re violated. This
allows us to get around another aspect of Rust’s mutability rules. Let’s talk
about it first.

#### Field-level mutability

Mutability is a property of either a borrow (`&mut`) or a binding (`let mut`).
This means that, for example, you cannot have a [`struct`][mutability.md--struct] with
some fields mutable and some immutable:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    mut y: i32, // nope
}
```

The mutability of a struct is in its binding:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let mut a = Point { x: 5, y: 6 };

a.x = 10;

let b = Point { x: 5, y: 6};

b.x = 10; // error: cannot assign to immutable field `b.x`
```

[mutability.md--struct]: #sec--structs

However, by using [`Cell<T>`][mutability.md--cell], you can emulate field-level mutability:

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: Cell<i32>,
}

let point = Point { x: 5, y: Cell::new(6) };

point.y.set(7);

println!("y: {:?}", point.y);
```

[mutability.md--cell]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html

This will print `y: Cell { value: 7 }`. We’ve successfully updated `y`.


## Structs {#sec--structs}


`struct`s are a way of creating more complex data types. For example, if we were
doing calculations involving coordinates in 2D space, we would need both an `x`
and a `y` value:

```rust
let origin_x = 0;
let origin_y = 0;
```

A `struct` lets us combine these two into a single, unified datatype with `x`
and `y` as field labels:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }; // origin: Point

    println!("The origin is at ({}, {})", origin.x, origin.y);
}
```

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. We declare a `struct` with
the `struct` keyword, and then with a name. By convention, `struct`s begin with
a capital letter and are camel cased: `PointInSpace`, not `Point_In_Space`.

We can create an instance of our `struct` via `let`, as usual, but we use a `key:
value` style syntax to set each field. The order doesn’t need to be the same as
in the original declaration.

Finally, because fields have names, we can access them through dot
notation: `origin.x`.

The values in `struct`s are immutable by default, like other bindings in Rust.
Use `mut` to make them mutable:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

    point.x = 5;

    println!("The point is at ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);
}
```

This will print `The point is at (5, 0)`.

Rust does not support field mutability at the language level, so you cannot
write something like this:

```rust
struct Point {
    mut x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

Mutability is a property of the binding, not of the structure itself. If you’re
used to field-level mutability, this may seem strange at first, but it
significantly simplifies things. It even lets you make things mutable on a temporary
basis:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

    point.x = 5;

    let point = point; // now immutable

    point.y = 6; // this causes an error
}
```

Your structure can still contain `&mut` pointers, which will let
you do some kinds of mutation:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

struct PointRef<'a> {
    x: &'a mut i32,
    y: &'a mut i32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

    {
        let r = PointRef { x: &mut point.x, y: &mut point.y };

        *r.x = 5;
        *r.y = 6;
    }

    assert_eq!(5, point.x);
    assert_eq!(6, point.y);
}
```

### Update syntax

A `struct` can include `..` to indicate that you want to use a copy of some
other `struct` for some of the values. For example:

```rust
struct Point3d {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    z: i32,
}

let mut point = Point3d { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
point = Point3d { y: 1, .. point };
```

This gives `point` a new `y`, but keeps the old `x` and `z` values. It doesn’t
have to be the same `struct` either, you can use this syntax when making new
ones, and it will copy the values you don’t specify:

```rust
let origin = Point3d { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };
let point = Point3d { z: 1, x: 2, .. origin };
```

### Tuple structs

Rust has another data type that’s like a hybrid between a [tuple][structs.md--tuple] and a
`struct`, called a ‘tuple struct’. Tuple structs have a name, but their fields
don't. They are declared with the `struct` keyword, and then with a name
followed by a tuple:

[structs.md--tuple]: #tuples

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```
Here, `black` and `origin` are not equal, even though they contain the same
values.

It is almost always better to use a `struct` than a tuple struct. We
would write `Color` and `Point` like this instead:

```rust
struct Color {
    red: i32,
    blue: i32,
    green: i32,
}

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    z: i32,
}
```

Good names are important, and while values in a tuple struct can be
referenced with dot notation as well, a `struct` gives us actual names,
rather than positions.

There _is_ one case when a tuple struct is very useful, though, and that is when
it has only one element. We call this the ‘newtype’ pattern, because
it allows you to create a new type that is distinct from its contained value
and also expresses its own semantic meaning:

```rust
struct Inches(i32);

let length = Inches(10);

let Inches(integer_length) = length;
println!("length is {} inches", integer_length);
```

As you can see here, you can extract the inner integer type through a
destructuring `let`, as with regular tuples. In this case, the
`let Inches(integer_length)` assigns `10` to `integer_length`.

### Unit-like structs

You can define a `struct` with no members at all:

```rust
struct Electron;

let x = Electron;
```

Such a `struct` is called ‘unit-like’ because it resembles the empty
tuple, `()`, sometimes called ‘unit’. Like a tuple struct, it defines a
new type.

This is rarely useful on its own (although sometimes it can serve as a
marker type), but in combination with other features, it can become
useful. For instance, a library may ask you to create a structure that
implements a certain [trait][structs.md--trait] to handle events. If you don’t have
any data you need to store in the structure, you can create a
unit-like `struct`.

[structs.md--trait]: #sec--traits


## Enums {#sec--enums}


An `enum` in Rust is a type that represents data that is one of
several possible variants. Each variant in the `enum` can optionally
have data associated with it:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
}
```

The syntax for defining variants resembles the syntaxes used to define structs:
you can have variants with no data (like unit-like structs), variants with named
data, and variants with unnamed data (like tuple structs). Unlike
separate struct definitions, however, an `enum` is a single type. A
value of the enum can match any of the variants. For this reason, an
enum is sometimes called a ‘sum type’: the set of possible values of the
enum is the sum of the sets of possible values for each variant.

We use the `::` syntax to use the name of each variant: they’re scoped by the name
of the `enum` itself. This allows both of these to work:

```rust
let x: Message = Message::Move { x: 3, y: 4 };

enum BoardGameTurn {
    Move { squares: i32 },
    Pass,
}

let y: BoardGameTurn = BoardGameTurn::Move { squares: 1 };
```

Both variants are named `Move`, but since they’re scoped to the name of
the enum, they can both be used without conflict.

A value of an `enum` type contains information about which variant it is,
in addition to any data associated with that variant. This is sometimes
referred to as a ‘tagged union’, since the data includes a ‘tag’
indicating what type it is. The compiler uses this information to
enforce that you’re accessing the data in the enum safely. For instance,
you can’t simply try to destructure a value as if it were one of the
possible variants:

```rust
fn process_color_change(msg: Message) {
    let Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) = msg; // compile-time error
}
```

Not supporting these operations may seem rather limiting, but it’s a limitation
which we can overcome. There are two ways: by implementing equality ourselves,
or by pattern matching variants with [`match`][enums.md--match] expressions, which you’ll
learn in the next section. We don’t know enough about Rust to implement
equality yet, but we’ll find out in the [`traits`][enums.md--traits] section.

[enums.md--match]: #sec--match
[enums.md--traits]: #sec--traits

### Constructors as functions

An `enum` constructor can also be used like a function. For example:

```rust
let m = Message::Write("Hello, world".to_string());
```

is the same as

```rust
fn foo(x: String) -> Message {
    Message::Write(x)
}

let x = foo("Hello, world".to_string());
```

This is not immediately useful to us, but when we get to
[`closures`][enums.md--closures], we’ll talk about passing functions as arguments to
other functions. For example, with [`iterators`][enums.md--iterators], we can do this
to convert a vector of `String`s into a vector of `Message::Write`s:

```rust

let v = vec!["Hello".to_string(), "World".to_string()];

let v1: Vec<Message> = v.into_iter().map(Message::Write).collect();
```

[enums.md--closures]: #sec--closures
[enums.md--iterators]: #sec--iterators


## Match {#sec--match}


Often, a simple [`if`][match.md--if]/`else` isn’t enough, because you have more than two
possible options. Also, conditions can get quite complex. Rust
has a keyword, `match`, that allows you to replace complicated `if`/`else`
groupings with something more powerful. Check it out:

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    4 => println!("four"),
    5 => println!("five"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}
```

[match.md--if]: #sec--if

`match` takes an expression and then branches based on its value. Each ‘arm’ of
the branch is of the form `val => expression`. When the value matches, that arm’s
expression will be evaluated. It’s called `match` because of the term ‘pattern
matching’, which `match` is an implementation of. There’s a [separate section on
patterns][match.md--patterns] that covers all the patterns that are possible here.

[match.md--patterns]: #sec--patterns

One of the many advantages of `match` is it enforces ‘exhaustiveness checking’. 
For example if we remove the last arm with the underscore `_`, the compiler will 
give us an error:

```text
error: non-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered
```

Rust is telling us that we forgot a value. The compiler infers from `x` that it
can have any positive 32bit value; for example 1 to 2,147,483,647. The `_` acts 
as a 'catch-all', and will catch all possible values that *aren't* specified in 
an arm of `match`. As you can see with the previous example, we provide `match` 
arms for integers 1-5, if `x` is 6 or any other value, then it is caught by `_`.

`match` is also an expression, which means we can use it on the right-hand
side of a `let` binding or directly where an expression is used:

```rust
let x = 5;

let number = match x {
    1 => "one",
    2 => "two",
    3 => "three",
    4 => "four",
    5 => "five",
    _ => "something else",
};
```

Sometimes it’s a nice way of converting something from one type to another; in 
this example the integers are converted to `String`.

### Matching on enums

Another important use of the `match` keyword is to process the possible
variants of an enum:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
}

fn quit() { /* ... */ }
fn change_color(r: i32, g: i32, b: i32) { /* ... */ }
fn move_cursor(x: i32, y: i32) { /* ... */ }

fn process_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => quit(),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => change_color(r, g, b),
        Message::Move { x: x, y: y } => move_cursor(x, y),
        Message::Write(s) => println!("{}", s),
    };
}
```

Again, the Rust compiler checks exhaustiveness, so it demands that you
have a match arm for every variant of the enum. If you leave one off, it
will give you a compile-time error unless you use `_` or provide all possible 
arms.

Unlike the previous uses of `match`, you can’t use the normal `if`
statement to do this. You can use the [`if let`][match.md--if-let] statement,
which can be seen as an abbreviated form of `match`.

[match.md--if-let]: #sec--if-let


## Patterns {#sec--patterns}


Patterns are quite common in Rust. We use them in [variable
bindings][patterns.md--bindings], [match statements][patterns.md--match], and other places, too. Let’s go
on a whirlwind tour of all of the things patterns can do!

[patterns.md--bindings]: #sec--variable-bindings
[patterns.md--match]: #sec--match

A quick refresher: you can match against literals directly, and `_` acts as an
‘any’ case:

```rust
let x = 1;

match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

This prints `one`.

There’s one pitfall with patterns: like anything that introduces a new binding,
they introduce shadowing. For example:

```rust
let x = 1;
let c = 'c';

match c {
    x => println!("x: {} c: {}", x, c),
}

println!("x: {}", x)
```

This prints:

```text
x: c c: c
x: 1
```

In other words, `x =>` matches the pattern and introduces a new binding named
`x`. This new binding is in scope for the match arm and takes on the value of
`c`. Notice that the value of `x` outside the scope of the match has no bearing
on the value of `x` within it. Because we already have a binding named `x`, this
new `x` shadows it.

### Multiple patterns

You can match multiple patterns with `|`:

```rust
let x = 1;

match x {
    1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

This prints `one or two`.

### Destructuring

If you have a compound data type, like a [`struct`][patterns.md--struct], you can destructure it
inside of a pattern:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

match origin {
    Point { x, y } => println!("({},{})", x, y),
}
```

[patterns.md--struct]: #sec--structs

We can use `:` to give a value a different name.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

match origin {
    Point { x: x1, y: y1 } => println!("({},{})", x1, y1),
}
```

If we only care about some of the values, we don’t have to give them all names:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

match origin {
    Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {}", x),
}
```

This prints `x is 0`.

You can do this kind of match on any member, not only the first:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

match origin {
    Point { y, .. } => println!("y is {}", y),
}
```

This prints `y is 0`.

This ‘destructuring’ behavior works on any compound data type, like
[tuples][patterns.md--tuples] or [enums][patterns.md--enums].

[patterns.md--tuples]: #tuples
[patterns.md--enums]: #sec--enums

### Ignoring bindings

You can use `_` in a pattern to disregard the type and value.
For example, here’s a `match` against a `Result<T, E>`:

```rust
match some_value {
    Ok(value) => println!("got a value: {}", value),
    Err(_) => println!("an error occurred"),
}
```

In the first arm, we bind the value inside the `Ok` variant to `value`. But
in the `Err` arm, we use `_` to disregard the specific error, and print
a general error message.

`_` is valid in any pattern that creates a binding. This can be useful to
ignore parts of a larger structure:

```rust
fn coordinate() -> (i32, i32, i32) {
    // generate and return some sort of triple tuple
}

let (x, _, z) = coordinate();
```

Here, we bind the first and last element of the tuple to `x` and `z`, but
ignore the middle element.

It’s worth noting that using `_` never binds the value in the first place,
which means a value may not move:

```rust
let tuple: (u32, String) = (5, String::from("five"));

// Here, tuple is moved, because the String moved:
let (x, _s) = tuple;

// The next line would give "error: use of partially moved value: `tuple`"
// println!("Tuple is: {:?}", tuple);

// However,

let tuple = (5, String::from("five"));

// Here, tuple is _not_ moved, as the String was never moved, and u32 is Copy:
let (x, _) = tuple;

// That means this works:
println!("Tuple is: {:?}", tuple);
```

This also means that any temporary variables will be dropped at the end of the
statement:

```rust
// Here, the String created will be dropped immediately, as it’s not bound:

let _ = String::from("  hello  ").trim();
```

You can also use `..` in a pattern to disregard multiple values:

```rust
enum OptionalTuple {
    Value(i32, i32, i32),
    Missing,
}

let x = OptionalTuple::Value(5, -2, 3);

match x {
    OptionalTuple::Value(..) => println!("Got a tuple!"),
    OptionalTuple::Missing => println!("No such luck."),
}
```

This prints `Got a tuple!`.

### ref and ref mut

If you want to get a [reference][patterns.md--ref], use the `ref` keyword:

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    ref r => println!("Got a reference to {}", r),
}
```

This prints `Got a reference to 5`.

[patterns.md--ref]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

Here, the `r` inside the `match` has the type `&i32`. In other words, the `ref`
keyword _creates_ a reference, for use in the pattern. If you need a mutable
reference, `ref mut` will work in the same way:

```rust
let mut x = 5;

match x {
    ref mut mr => println!("Got a mutable reference to {}", mr),
}
```

### Ranges

You can match a range of values with `...`:

```rust
let x = 1;

match x {
    1 ... 5 => println!("one through five"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

This prints `one through five`.

Ranges are mostly used with integers and `char`s:

```rust
let x = '💅';

match x {
    'a' ... 'j' => println!("early letter"),
    'k' ... 'z' => println!("late letter"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}
```

This prints `something else`.

### Bindings

You can bind values to names with `@`:

```rust
let x = 1;

match x {
    e @ 1 ... 5 => println!("got a range element {}", e),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

This prints `got a range element 1`. This is useful when you want to
do a complicated match of part of a data structure:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: Option<String>,
}

let name = "Steve".to_string();
let x: Option<Person> = Some(Person { name: Some(name) });
match x {
    Some(Person { name: ref a @ Some(_), .. }) => println!("{:?}", a),
    _ => {}
}
```

This prints `Some("Steve")`: we’ve bound the inner `name` to `a`.

If you use `@` with `|`, you need to make sure the name is bound in each part
of the pattern:

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    e @ 1 ... 5 | e @ 8 ... 10 => println!("got a range element {}", e),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

### Guards

You can introduce ‘match guards’ with `if`:

```rust
enum OptionalInt {
    Value(i32),
    Missing,
}

let x = OptionalInt::Value(5);

match x {
    OptionalInt::Value(i) if i > 5 => println!("Got an int bigger than five!"),
    OptionalInt::Value(..) => println!("Got an int!"),
    OptionalInt::Missing => println!("No such luck."),
}
```

This prints `Got an int!`.

If you’re using `if` with multiple patterns, the `if` applies to both sides:

```rust
let x = 4;
let y = false;

match x {
    4 | 5 if y => println!("yes"),
    _ => println!("no"),
}
```

This prints `no`, because the `if` applies to the whole of `4 | 5`, and not to
only the `5`. In other words, the precedence of `if` behaves like this:

```text
(4 | 5) if y => ...
```

not this:

```text
4 | (5 if y) => ...
```

### Mix and Match

Whew! That’s a lot of different ways to match things, and they can all be
mixed and matched, depending on what you’re doing:

```rust
match x {
    Foo { x: Some(ref name), y: None } => ...
}
```

Patterns are very powerful. Make good use of them.


## Method Syntax {#sec--method-syntax}


Functions are great, but if you want to call a bunch of them on some data, it
can be awkward. Consider this code:

```rust
baz(bar(foo));
```

We would read this left-to-right, and so we see ‘baz bar foo’. But this isn’t the
order that the functions would get called in, that’s inside-out: ‘foo bar baz’.
Wouldn’t it be nice if we could do this instead?

```rust
foo.bar().baz();
```

Luckily, as you may have guessed with the leading question, you can! Rust provides
the ability to use this ‘method call syntax’ via the `impl` keyword.

### Method calls

Here’s how it works:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = Circle { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius: 2.0 };
    println!("{}", c.area());
}
```

This will print `12.566371`.

We’ve made a `struct` that represents a circle. We then write an `impl` block,
and inside it, define a method, `area`.

Methods take a special first parameter, of which there are three variants:
`self`, `&self`, and `&mut self`. You can think of this first parameter as
being the `foo` in `foo.bar()`. The three variants correspond to the three
kinds of things `foo` could be: `self` if it’s a value on the stack,
`&self` if it’s a reference, and `&mut self` if it’s a mutable reference.
Because we took the `&self` parameter to `area`, we can use it like any
other parameter. Because we know it’s a `Circle`, we can access the `radius`
like we would with any other `struct`.

We should default to using `&self`, as you should prefer borrowing over taking
ownership, as well as taking immutable references over mutable ones. Here’s an
example of all three variants:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn reference(&self) {
       println!("taking self by reference!");
    }

    fn mutable_reference(&mut self) {
       println!("taking self by mutable reference!");
    }

    fn takes_ownership(self) {
       println!("taking ownership of self!");
    }
}
```

You can use as many `impl` blocks as you’d like. The previous example could
have also been written like this:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn reference(&self) {
       println!("taking self by reference!");
    }
}

impl Circle {
    fn mutable_reference(&mut self) {
       println!("taking self by mutable reference!");
    }
}

impl Circle {
    fn takes_ownership(self) {
       println!("taking ownership of self!");
    }
}
```

### Chaining method calls

So, now we know how to call a method, such as `foo.bar()`. But what about our
original example, `foo.bar().baz()`? This is called ‘method chaining’. Let’s
look at an example:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }

    fn grow(&self, increment: f64) -> Circle {
        Circle { x: self.x, y: self.y, radius: self.radius + increment }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = Circle { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius: 2.0 };
    println!("{}", c.area());

    let d = c.grow(2.0).area();
    println!("{}", d);
}
```

Check the return type:

```rust
fn grow(&self, increment: f64) -> Circle {
```

We say we’re returning a `Circle`. With this method, we can grow a new
`Circle` to any arbitrary size.

### Associated functions

You can also define associated functions that do not take a `self` parameter.
Here’s a pattern that’s very common in Rust code:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64, radius: f64) -> Circle {
        Circle {
            x: x,
            y: y,
            radius: radius,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = Circle::new(0.0, 0.0, 2.0);
}
```

This ‘associated function’ builds a new `Circle` for us. Note that associated
functions are called with the `Struct::function()` syntax, rather than the
`ref.method()` syntax. Some other languages call associated functions ‘static
methods’.

### Builder Pattern

Let’s say that we want our users to be able to create `Circle`s, but we will
allow them to only set the properties they care about. Otherwise, the `x`
and `y` attributes will be `0.0`, and the `radius` will be `1.0`. Rust doesn’t
have method overloading, named arguments, or variable arguments. We employ
the builder pattern instead. It looks like this:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}

struct CircleBuilder {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl CircleBuilder {
    fn new() -> CircleBuilder {
        CircleBuilder { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, radius: 1.0, }
    }

    fn x(&mut self, coordinate: f64) -> &mut CircleBuilder {
        self.x = coordinate;
        self
    }

    fn y(&mut self, coordinate: f64) -> &mut CircleBuilder {
        self.y = coordinate;
        self
    }

    fn radius(&mut self, radius: f64) -> &mut CircleBuilder {
        self.radius = radius;
        self
    }

    fn finalize(&self) -> Circle {
        Circle { x: self.x, y: self.y, radius: self.radius }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CircleBuilder::new()
                .x(1.0)
                .y(2.0)
                .radius(2.0)
                .finalize();

    println!("area: {}", c.area());
    println!("x: {}", c.x);
    println!("y: {}", c.y);
}
```

What we’ve done here is make another `struct`, `CircleBuilder`. We’ve defined our
builder methods on it. We’ve also defined our `area()` method on `Circle`. We
also made one more method on `CircleBuilder`: `finalize()`. This method creates
our final `Circle` from the builder. Now, we’ve used the type system to enforce
our concerns: we can use the methods on `CircleBuilder` to constrain making
`Circle`s in any way we choose.


## Vectors {#sec--vectors}


A ‘vector’ is a dynamic or ‘growable’ array, implemented as the standard
library type [`Vec<T>`][vectors.md--vec]. The `T` means that we can have vectors
of any type (see the chapter on [generics][vectors.md--generic] for more).
Vectors always allocate their data on the heap.
You can create them with the `vec!` macro:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // v: Vec<i32>
```

(Notice that unlike the `println!` macro we’ve used in the past, we use square
brackets `[]` with `vec!` macro. Rust allows you to use either in either
situation, this is just convention.)

There’s an alternate form of `vec!` for repeating an initial value:

```rust
let v = vec![0; 10]; // ten zeroes
```

Vectors store their contents as contiguous arrays of `T` on the heap. This means
that they must be able to know the size of `T` at compile time (that is, how
many bytes are needed to store a `T`?). The size of some things can't be known
at compile time. For these you'll have to store a pointer to that thing:
thankfully, the [`Box`][vectors.md--box] type works perfectly for this.

#### Accessing elements

To get the value at a particular index in the vector, we use `[]`s:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

println!("The third element of v is {}", v[2]);
```

The indices count from `0`, so the third element is `v[2]`.

It’s also important to note that you must index with the `usize` type:

```ignore
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let i: usize = 0;
let j: i32 = 0;

// works
v[i];

// doesn’t
v[j];
```

Indexing with a non-`usize` type gives an error that looks like this:

```text
error: the trait `core::ops::Index<i32>` is not implemented for the type
`collections::vec::Vec<_>` [E0277]
v[j];
^~~~
note: the type `collections::vec::Vec<_>` cannot be indexed by `i32`
error: aborting due to previous error
```

There’s a lot of punctuation in that message, but the core of it makes sense:
you cannot index with an `i32`.

#### Out-of-bounds Access

If you try to access an index that doesn’t exist:

```ignore
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("Item 7 is {}", v[7]);
```

then the current thread will [panic] with a message like this:

```text
thread '<main>' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 7'
```

If you want to handle out-of-bounds errors without panicking, you can use
methods like [`get`][vectors.md--get] or [`get_mut`][vectors.md--get_mut] that return `None` when
given an invalid index:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
match v.get(7) {
    Some(x) => println!("Item 7 is {}", x),
    None => println!("Sorry, this vector is too short.")
}
```

#### Iterating

Once you have a vector, you can iterate through its elements with `for`. There
are three versions:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for i in &v {
    println!("A reference to {}", i);
}

for i in &mut v {
    println!("A mutable reference to {}", i);
}

for i in v {
    println!("Take ownership of the vector and its element {}", i);
}
```

Vectors have many more useful methods, which you can read about in [their
API documentation][vectors.md--vec].

## Strings {#sec--strings}


Strings are an important concept for any programmer to master. Rust’s string
handling system is a bit different from other languages, due to its systems
focus. Any time you have a data structure of variable size, things can get
tricky, and strings are a re-sizable data structure. That being said, Rust’s
strings also work differently than in some other systems languages, such as C.

Let’s dig into the details. A ‘string’ is a sequence of Unicode scalar values
encoded as a stream of UTF-8 bytes. All strings are guaranteed to be a valid
encoding of UTF-8 sequences. Additionally, unlike some systems languages,
strings are not null-terminated and can contain null bytes.

Rust has two main types of strings: `&str` and `String`. Let’s talk about
`&str` first. These are called ‘string slices’. A string slice has a fixed
size, and cannot be mutated. It is a reference to a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.

```rust
let greeting = "Hello there."; // greeting: &'static str
```

`"Hello there."` is a string literal and its type is `&'static str`. A string
literal is a string slice that is statically allocated, meaning that it’s saved
inside our compiled program, and exists for the entire duration it runs. The
`greeting` binding is a reference to this statically allocated string. Any
function expecting a string slice will also accept a string literal.

String literals can span multiple lines. There are two forms. The first will
include the newline and the leading spaces:

```rust
let s = "foo
    bar";

assert_eq!("foo\n        bar", s);
```

The second, with a `\`, trims the spaces and the newline:

```rust
let s = "foo\
    bar";

assert_eq!("foobar", s);
```

Rust has more than only `&str`s though. A `String`, is a heap-allocated string.
This string is growable, and is also guaranteed to be UTF-8. `String`s are
commonly created by converting from a string slice using the `to_string`
method.

```rust
let mut s = "Hello".to_string(); // mut s: String
println!("{}", s);

s.push_str(", world.");
println!("{}", s);
```

`String`s will coerce into `&str` with an `&`:

```rust
fn takes_slice(slice: &str) {
    println!("Got: {}", slice);
}

fn main() {
    let s = "Hello".to_string();
    takes_slice(&s);
}
```

This coercion does not happen for functions that accept one of `&str`’s traits
instead of `&str`. For example, [`TcpStream::connect`][strings.md--connect] has a parameter
of type `ToSocketAddrs`. A `&str` is okay but a `String` must be explicitly
converted using `&*`.

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;

TcpStream::connect("192.168.0.1:3000"); // &str parameter

let addr_string = "192.168.0.1:3000".to_string();
TcpStream::connect(&*addr_string); // convert addr_string to &str
```

Viewing a `String` as a `&str` is cheap, but converting the `&str` to a
`String` involves allocating memory. No reason to do that unless you have to!

#### Indexing

Because strings are valid UTF-8, strings do not support indexing:

```rust
let s = "hello";

println!("The first letter of s is {}", s[0]); // ERROR!!!
```

Usually, access to a vector with `[]` is very fast. But, because each character
in a UTF-8 encoded string can be multiple bytes, you have to walk over the
string to find the nᵗʰ letter of a string. This is a significantly more
expensive operation, and we don’t want to be misleading. Furthermore, ‘letter’
isn’t something defined in Unicode, exactly. We can choose to look at a string as
individual bytes, or as codepoints:

```rust
let hachiko = "忠犬ハチ公";

for b in hachiko.as_bytes() {
    print!("{}, ", b);
}

println!("");

for c in hachiko.chars() {
    print!("{}, ", c);
}

println!("");
```

This prints:

```text
229, 191, 160, 231, 138, 172, 227, 131, 143, 227, 131, 129, 229, 133, 172,
忠, 犬, ハ, チ, 公,
```

As you can see, there are more bytes than `char`s.

You can get something similar to an index like this:

```rust
let dog = hachiko.chars().nth(1); // kinda like hachiko[1]
```

This emphasizes that we have to walk from the beginning of the list of `chars`.

#### Slicing

You can get a slice of a string with slicing syntax:

```rust
let dog = "hachiko";
let hachi = &dog[0..5];
```

But note that these are _byte_ offsets, not _character_ offsets. So
this will fail at runtime:

```rust
let dog = "忠犬ハチ公";
let hachi = &dog[0..2];
```

with this error:

```text
thread '<main>' panicked at 'index 0 and/or 2 in `忠犬ハチ公` do not lie on
character boundary'
```

#### Concatenation

If you have a `String`, you can concatenate a `&str` to the end of it:

```rust
let hello = "Hello ".to_string();
let world = "world!";

let hello_world = hello + world;
```

But if you have two `String`s, you need an `&`:

```rust
let hello = "Hello ".to_string();
let world = "world!".to_string();

let hello_world = hello + &world;
```

This is because `&String` can automatically coerce to a `&str`. This is a
feature called ‘[`Deref` coercions][strings.md--dc]’.

[strings.md--connect]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.connect


## Generics {#sec--generics}


Sometimes, when writing a function or data type, we may want it to work for
multiple types of arguments. In Rust, we can do this with generics.
Generics are called ‘parametric polymorphism’ in type theory,
which means that they are types or functions that have multiple forms (‘poly’
is multiple, ‘morph’ is form) over a given parameter (‘parametric’).

Anyway, enough type theory, let’s check out some generic code. Rust’s
standard library provides a type, `Option<T>`, that’s generic:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

The `<T>` part, which you’ve seen a few times before, indicates that this is
a generic data type. Inside the declaration of our `enum`, wherever we see a `T`,
we substitute that type for the same type used in the generic. Here’s an
example of using `Option<T>`, with some extra type annotations:

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);
```

In the type declaration, we say `Option<i32>`. Note how similar this looks to
`Option<T>`. So, in this particular `Option`, `T` has the value of `i32`. On
the right-hand side of the binding, we make a `Some(T)`, where `T` is `5`.
Since that’s an `i32`, the two sides match, and Rust is happy. If they didn’t
match, we’d get an error:

```rust
let x: Option<f64> = Some(5);
// error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<f64>`,
// found `core::option::Option<_>` (expected f64 but found integral variable)
```

That doesn’t mean we can’t make `Option<T>`s that hold an `f64`! They have
to match up:

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);
let y: Option<f64> = Some(5.0f64);
```

This is just fine. One definition, multiple uses.

Generics don’t have to only be generic over one type. Consider another type from Rust’s standard library that’s similar, `Result<T, E>`:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

This type is generic over _two_ types: `T` and `E`. By the way, the capital letters
can be any letter you’d like. We could define `Result<T, E>` as:

```rust
enum Result<A, Z> {
    Ok(A),
    Err(Z),
}
```

if we wanted to. Convention says that the first generic parameter should be
`T`, for ‘type’, and that we use `E` for ‘error’. Rust doesn’t care, however.

The `Result<T, E>` type is intended to be used to return the result of a
computation, and to have the ability to return an error if it didn’t work out.

#### Generic functions

We can write functions that take generic types with a similar syntax:

```rust
fn takes_anything<T>(x: T) {
    // do something with x
}
```

The syntax has two parts: the `<T>` says “this function is generic over one
type, `T`”, and the `x: T` says “x has the type `T`.”

Multiple arguments can have the same generic type:

```rust
fn takes_two_of_the_same_things<T>(x: T, y: T) {
    // ...
}
```

We could write a version that takes multiple types:

```rust
fn takes_two_things<T, U>(x: T, y: U) {
    // ...
}
```

#### Generic structs

You can store a generic type in a `struct` as well:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

let int_origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
let float_origin = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
```

Similar to functions, the `<T>` is where we declare the generic parameters,
and we then use `x: T` in the type declaration, too.

When you want to add an implementation for the generic `struct`, you
declare the type parameter after the `impl`:

```rust
impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn swap(&mut self) {
        std::mem::swap(&mut self.x, &mut self.y);
    }
}
```

So far you’ve seen generics that take absolutely any type. These are useful in
many cases: you’ve already seen `Option<T>`, and later you’ll meet universal
container types like [`Vec<T>`][generics.md--Vec]. On the other hand, often you want to
trade that flexibility for increased expressive power. Read about [trait
bounds][generics.md--traits] to see why and how.

[generics.md--traits]: #sec--traits
[generics.md--Vec]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html


## Traits {#sec--traits}


A trait is a language feature that tells the Rust compiler about
functionality a type must provide.

Recall the `impl` keyword, used to call a function with [method
syntax][traits.md--methodsyntax]:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}
```

[traits.md--methodsyntax]: #sec--method-syntax

Traits are similar, except that we first define a trait with a method
signature, then implement the trait for a type. In this example, we implement the trait `HasArea` for `Circle`:

```rust
struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

trait HasArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

impl HasArea for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}
```

As you can see, the `trait` block looks very similar to the `impl` block,
but we don’t define a body, only a type signature. When we `impl` a trait,
we use `impl Trait for Item`, rather than only `impl Item`.

#### Trait bounds on generic functions

Traits are useful because they allow a type to make certain promises about its
behavior. Generic functions can exploit this to constrain, or [bound][traits.md--bounds], the types they
accept. Consider this function, which does not compile:

[traits.md--bounds]: #bounds

```rust
fn print_area<T>(shape: T) {
    println!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area());
}
```

Rust complains:

```text
error: no method named `area` found for type `T` in the current scope
```

Because `T` can be any type, we can’t be sure that it implements the `area`
method. But we can add a trait bound to our generic `T`, ensuring
that it does:

```rust
fn print_area<T: HasArea>(shape: T) {
    println!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area());
}
```

The syntax `<T: HasArea>` means “any type that implements the `HasArea` trait.”
Because traits define function type signatures, we can be sure that any type
which implements `HasArea` will have an `.area()` method.

Here’s an extended example of how this works:

```rust
trait HasArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    radius: f64,
}

impl HasArea for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius)
    }
}

struct Square {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    side: f64,
}

impl HasArea for Square {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.side * self.side
    }
}

fn print_area<T: HasArea>(shape: T) {
    println!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area());
}

fn main() {
    let c = Circle {
        x: 0.0f64,
        y: 0.0f64,
        radius: 1.0f64,
    };

    let s = Square {
        x: 0.0f64,
        y: 0.0f64,
        side: 1.0f64,
    };

    print_area(c);
    print_area(s);
}
```

This program outputs:

```text
This shape has an area of 3.141593
This shape has an area of 1
```

As you can see, `print_area` is now generic, but also ensures that we have
passed in the correct types. If we pass in an incorrect type:

```rust
print_area(5);
```

We get a compile-time error:

```text
error: the trait `HasArea` is not implemented for the type `_` [E0277]
```

#### Trait bounds on generic structs

Your generic structs can also benefit from trait bounds. All you need to
do is append the bound when you declare type parameters. Here is a new
type `Rectangle<T>` and its operation `is_square()`:

```rust
struct Rectangle<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
    width: T,
    height: T,
}

impl<T: PartialEq> Rectangle<T> {
    fn is_square(&self) -> bool {
        self.width == self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut r = Rectangle {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        width: 47,
        height: 47,
    };

    assert!(r.is_square());

    r.height = 42;
    assert!(!r.is_square());
}
```

`is_square()` needs to check that the sides are equal, so the sides must be of
a type that implements the [`core::cmp::PartialEq`][traits.md--PartialEq] trait:

```ignore
impl<T: PartialEq> Rectangle<T> { ... }
```

Now, a rectangle can be defined in terms of any type that can be compared for
equality.

[traits.md--PartialEq]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html

Here we defined a new struct `Rectangle` that accepts numbers of any
precision—really, objects of pretty much any type—as long as they can be
compared for equality. Could we do the same for our `HasArea` structs, `Square`
and `Circle`? Yes, but they need multiplication, and to work with that we need
to know more about [operator traits][traits.md--operators-and-overloading].

[traits.md--operators-and-overloading]: #sec--operators-and-overloading

### Rules for implementing traits

So far, we’ve only added trait implementations to structs, but you can
implement a trait for any type. So technically, we _could_ implement `HasArea`
for `i32`:

```rust
trait HasArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

impl HasArea for i32 {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        println!("this is silly");

        *self as f64
    }
}

5.area();
```

It is considered poor style to implement methods on such primitive types, even
though it is possible.

This may seem like the Wild West, but there are two restrictions around
implementing traits that prevent this from getting out of hand. The first is
that if the trait isn’t defined in your scope, it doesn’t apply. Here’s an
example: the standard library provides a [`Write`][traits.md--write] trait which adds
extra functionality to `File`s, for doing file I/O. By default, a `File`
won’t have its methods:

[traits.md--write]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html

```rust
let mut f = std::fs::File::open("foo.txt").expect("Couldn’t open foo.txt");
let buf = b"whatever"; // byte string literal. buf: &[u8; 8]
let result = f.write(buf);
```

Here’s the error:

```text
error: type `std::fs::File` does not implement any method in scope named `write`
let result = f.write(buf);
               ^~~~~~~~~~
```

We need to `use` the `Write` trait first:

```rust
use std::io::Write;

let mut f = std::fs::File::open("foo.txt").expect("Couldn’t open foo.txt");
let buf = b"whatever";
let result = f.write(buf);
```

This will compile without error.

This means that even if someone does something bad like add methods to `i32`,
it won’t affect you, unless you `use` that trait.

There’s one more restriction on implementing traits: either the trait
or the type you’re implementing it for must be defined by you. Or more
precisely, one of them must be defined in the same crate as the `impl`
you're writing. For more on Rust's module and package system, see the
chapter on [crates and modules][traits.md--cm].

So, we could implement the `HasArea` type for `i32`, because we defined
`HasArea` in our code. But if we tried to implement `ToString`, a trait
provided by Rust, for `i32`, we could not, because neither the trait nor
the type are defined in our crate.

One last thing about traits: generic functions with a trait bound use
‘monomorphization’ (mono: one, morph: form), so they are statically dispatched.
What’s that mean? Check out the chapter on [trait objects][traits.md--to] for more details.

[traits.md--cm]: #sec--crates-and-modules
[traits.md--to]: #sec--trait-objects

### Multiple trait bounds

You’ve seen that you can bound a generic type parameter with a trait:

```rust
fn foo<T: Clone>(x: T) {
    x.clone();
}
```

If you need more than one bound, you can use `+`:

```rust
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn foo<T: Clone + Debug>(x: T) {
    x.clone();
    println!("{:?}", x);
}
```

`T` now needs to be both `Clone` as well as `Debug`.

### Where clause

Writing functions with only a few generic types and a small number of trait
bounds isn’t too bad, but as the number increases, the syntax gets increasingly
awkward:

```rust
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn foo<T: Clone, K: Clone + Debug>(x: T, y: K) {
    x.clone();
    y.clone();
    println!("{:?}", y);
}
```

The name of the function is on the far left, and the parameter list is on the
far right. The bounds are getting in the way.

Rust has a solution, and it’s called a ‘`where` clause’:

```rust
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn foo<T: Clone, K: Clone + Debug>(x: T, y: K) {
    x.clone();
    y.clone();
    println!("{:?}", y);
}

fn bar<T, K>(x: T, y: K) where T: Clone, K: Clone + Debug {
    x.clone();
    y.clone();
    println!("{:?}", y);
}

fn main() {
    foo("Hello", "world");
    bar("Hello", "world");
}
```

`foo()` uses the syntax we showed earlier, and `bar()` uses a `where` clause.
All you need to do is leave off the bounds when defining your type parameters,
and then add `where` after the parameter list. For longer lists, whitespace can
be added:

```rust
use std::fmt::Debug;

fn bar<T, K>(x: T, y: K)
    where T: Clone,
          K: Clone + Debug {

    x.clone();
    y.clone();
    println!("{:?}", y);
}
```

This flexibility can add clarity in complex situations.

`where` is also more powerful than the simpler syntax. For example:

```rust
trait ConvertTo<Output> {
    fn convert(&self) -> Output;
}

impl ConvertTo<i64> for i32 {
    fn convert(&self) -> i64 { *self as i64 }
}

// can be called with T == i32
fn normal<T: ConvertTo<i64>>(x: &T) -> i64 {
    x.convert()
}

// can be called with T == i64
fn inverse<T>() -> T
        // this is using ConvertTo as if it were "ConvertTo<i64>"
        where i32: ConvertTo<T> {
    42.convert()
}
```

This shows off the additional feature of `where` clauses: they allow bounds
on the left-hand side not only of type parameters `T`, but also of types (`i32` in this case). In this example, `i32` must implement
`ConvertTo<T>`. Rather than defining what `i32` is (since that's obvious), the
`where` clause here constrains `T`.

### Default methods

A default method can be added to a trait definition if it is already known how a typical implementor will define a method. For example, `is_invalid()` is defined as the opposite of `is_valid()`:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool;

    fn is_invalid(&self) -> bool { !self.is_valid() }
}
```

Implementors of the `Foo` trait need to implement `is_valid()` but not `is_invalid()` due to the added default behavior. This default behavior can still be overridden as in:

```rust
struct UseDefault;

impl Foo for UseDefault {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        println!("Called UseDefault.is_valid.");
        true
    }
}

struct OverrideDefault;

impl Foo for OverrideDefault {
    fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        println!("Called OverrideDefault.is_valid.");
        true
    }

    fn is_invalid(&self) -> bool {
        println!("Called OverrideDefault.is_invalid!");
        true // overrides the expected value of is_invalid()
    }
}

let default = UseDefault;
assert!(!default.is_invalid()); // prints "Called UseDefault.is_valid."

let over = OverrideDefault;
assert!(over.is_invalid()); // prints "Called OverrideDefault.is_invalid!"
```

### Inheritance

Sometimes, implementing a trait requires implementing another trait:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self);
}

trait FooBar : Foo {
    fn foobar(&self);
}
```

Implementors of `FooBar` must also implement `Foo`, like this:

```rust
struct Baz;

impl Foo for Baz {
    fn foo(&self) { println!("foo"); }
}

impl FooBar for Baz {
    fn foobar(&self) { println!("foobar"); }
}
```

If we forget to implement `Foo`, Rust will tell us:

```text
error: the trait `main::Foo` is not implemented for the type `main::Baz` [E0277]
```

### Deriving

Implementing traits like `Debug` and `Default` repeatedly can become
quite tedious. For that reason, Rust provides an [attribute][traits.md--attributes] that
allows you to let Rust automatically implement traits for you:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo;

fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", Foo);
}
```

[traits.md--attributes]: #sec--attributes

However, deriving is limited to a certain set of traits:

- [`Clone`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/clone/trait.Clone.html)
- [`Copy`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Copy.html)
- [`Debug`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/fmt/trait.Debug.html)
- [`Default`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/default/trait.Default.html)
- [`Eq`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cmp/trait.Eq.html)
- [`Hash`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/hash/trait.Hash.html)
- [`Ord`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cmp/trait.Ord.html)
- [`PartialEq`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html)
- [`PartialOrd`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html)


## Drop {#sec--drop}


Now that we’ve discussed traits, let’s talk about a particular trait provided
by the Rust standard library, [`Drop`][drop.md--drop]. The `Drop` trait provides a way
to run some code when a value goes out of scope. For example:

[drop.md--drop]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html

```rust
struct HasDrop;

impl Drop for HasDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = HasDrop;

    // do stuff

} // x goes out of scope here
```

When `x` goes out of scope at the end of `main()`, the code for `Drop` will
run. `Drop` has one method, which is also called `drop()`. It takes a mutable
reference to `self`.

That’s it! The mechanics of `Drop` are very simple, but there are some
subtleties. For example, values are dropped in the opposite order they are
declared. Here’s another example:

```rust
struct Firework {
    strength: i32,
}

impl Drop for Firework {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("BOOM times {}!!!", self.strength);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let firecracker = Firework { strength: 1 };
    let tnt = Firework { strength: 100 };
}
```

This will output:

```text
BOOM times 100!!!
BOOM times 1!!!
```

The TNT goes off before the firecracker does, because it was declared
afterwards. Last in, first out.

So what is `Drop` good for? Generally, `Drop` is used to clean up any resources
associated with a `struct`. For example, the [`Arc<T>` type][drop.md--arc] is a
reference-counted type. When `Drop` is called, it will decrement the reference
count, and if the total number of references is zero, will clean up the
underlying value.

[drop.md--arc]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html


## if let {#sec--if-let}


`if let` allows you to combine `if` and `let` together to reduce the overhead
of certain kinds of pattern matches.

For example, let’s say we have some sort of `Option<T>`. We want to call a function
on it if it’s `Some<T>`, but do nothing if it’s `None`. That looks like this:

```rust
match option {
    Some(x) => { foo(x) },
    None => {},
}
```

We don’t have to use `match` here, for example, we could use `if`:

```rust
if option.is_some() {
    let x = option.unwrap();
    foo(x);
}
```

Neither of these options is particularly appealing. We can use `if let` to
do the same thing in a nicer way:

```rust
if let Some(x) = option {
    foo(x);
}
```

If a [pattern][if-let.md--patterns] matches successfully, it binds any appropriate parts of
the value to the identifiers in the pattern, then evaluates the expression. If
the pattern doesn’t match, nothing happens.

If you want to do something else when the pattern does not match, you can
use `else`:

```rust
if let Some(x) = option {
    foo(x);
} else {
    bar();
}
```

#### `while let`

In a similar fashion, `while let` can be used when you want to conditionally
loop  as long as a value matches a certain pattern. It turns code like this:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 3, 5, 7, 11];
loop {
    match v.pop() {
        Some(x) =>  println!("{}", x),
        None => break,
    }
}
```

Into code like this:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 3, 5, 7, 11];
while let Some(x) = v.pop() {
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

[if-let.md--patterns]: #sec--patterns


## Trait Objects {#sec--trait-objects}


When code involves polymorphism, there needs to be a mechanism to determine
which specific version is actually run. This is called ‘dispatch’. There are
two major forms of dispatch: static dispatch and dynamic dispatch. While Rust
favors static dispatch, it also supports dynamic dispatch through a mechanism
called ‘trait objects’.

#### Background

For the rest of this chapter, we’ll need a trait and some implementations.
Let’s make a simple one, `Foo`. It has one method that is expected to return a
`String`.

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn method(&self) -> String;
}
```

We’ll also implement this trait for `u8` and `String`:

```rust
impl Foo for u8 {
    fn method(&self) -> String { format!("u8: {}", *self) }
}

impl Foo for String {
    fn method(&self) -> String { format!("string: {}", *self) }
}
```


#### Static dispatch

We can use this trait to perform static dispatch with trait bounds:

```rust
fn do_something<T: Foo>(x: T) {
    x.method();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5u8;
    let y = "Hello".to_string();

    do_something(x);
    do_something(y);
}
```

Rust uses ‘monomorphization’ to perform static dispatch here. This means that
Rust will create a special version of `do_something()` for both `u8` and
`String`, and then replace the call sites with calls to these specialized
functions. In other words, Rust generates something like this:

```rust
fn do_something_u8(x: u8) {
    x.method();
}

fn do_something_string(x: String) {
    x.method();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5u8;
    let y = "Hello".to_string();

    do_something_u8(x);
    do_something_string(y);
}
```

This has a great upside: static dispatch allows function calls to be
inlined because the callee is known at compile time, and inlining is
the key to good optimization. Static dispatch is fast, but it comes at
a tradeoff: ‘code bloat’, due to many copies of the same function
existing in the binary, one for each type.

Furthermore, compilers aren’t perfect and may “optimize” code to become slower.
For example, functions inlined too eagerly will bloat the instruction cache
(cache rules everything around us). This is part of the reason that `#[inline]`
and `#[inline(always)]` should be used carefully, and one reason why using a
dynamic dispatch is sometimes more efficient.

However, the common case is that it is more efficient to use static dispatch,
and one can always have a thin statically-dispatched wrapper function that does
a dynamic dispatch, but not vice versa, meaning static calls are more flexible.
The standard library tries to be statically dispatched where possible for this
reason.

#### Dynamic dispatch

Rust provides dynamic dispatch through a feature called ‘trait objects’. Trait
objects, like `&Foo` or `Box<Foo>`, are normal values that store a value of
*any* type that implements the given trait, where the precise type can only be
known at runtime.

A trait object can be obtained from a pointer to a concrete type that
implements the trait by *casting* it (e.g. `&x as &Foo`) or *coercing* it
(e.g. using `&x` as an argument to a function that takes `&Foo`).

These trait object coercions and casts also work for pointers like `&mut T` to
`&mut Foo` and `Box<T>` to `Box<Foo>`, but that’s all at the moment. Coercions
and casts are identical.

This operation can be seen as ‘erasing’ the compiler’s knowledge about the
specific type of the pointer, and hence trait objects are sometimes referred to
as ‘type erasure’.

Coming back to the example above, we can use the same trait to perform dynamic
dispatch with trait objects by casting:

```rust

fn do_something(x: &Foo) {
    x.method();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5u8;
    do_something(&x as &Foo);
}
```

or by coercing:

```rust

fn do_something(x: &Foo) {
    x.method();
}

fn main() {
    let x = "Hello".to_string();
    do_something(&x);
}
```

A function that takes a trait object is not specialized to each of the types
that implements `Foo`: only one copy is generated, often (but not always)
resulting in less code bloat. However, this comes at the cost of requiring
slower virtual function calls, and effectively inhibiting any chance of
inlining and related optimizations from occurring.

##### Why pointers?

Rust does not put things behind a pointer by default, unlike many managed
languages, so types can have different sizes. Knowing the size of the value at
compile time is important for things like passing it as an argument to a
function, moving it about on the stack and allocating (and deallocating) space
on the heap to store it.

For `Foo`, we would need to have a value that could be at least either a
`String` (24 bytes) or a `u8` (1 byte), as well as any other type for which
dependent crates may implement `Foo` (any number of bytes at all). There’s no
way to guarantee that this last point can work if the values are stored without
a pointer, because those other types can be arbitrarily large.

Putting the value behind a pointer means the size of the value is not relevant
when we are tossing a trait object around, only the size of the pointer itself.

##### Representation

The methods of the trait can be called on a trait object via a special record
of function pointers traditionally called a ‘vtable’ (created and managed by
the compiler).

Trait objects are both simple and complicated: their core representation and
layout is quite straight-forward, but there are some curly error messages and
surprising behaviors to discover.

Let’s start simple, with the runtime representation of a trait object. The
`std::raw` module contains structs with layouts that are the same as the
complicated built-in types, [including trait objects][trait-objects.md--stdraw]:

```rust
pub struct TraitObject {
    pub data: *mut (),
    pub vtable: *mut (),
}
```

[trait-objects.md--stdraw]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/raw/struct.TraitObject.html

That is, a trait object like `&Foo` consists of a ‘data’ pointer and a ‘vtable’
pointer.

The data pointer addresses the data (of some unknown type `T`) that the trait
object is storing, and the vtable pointer points to the vtable (‘virtual method
table’) corresponding to the implementation of `Foo` for `T`.


A vtable is essentially a struct of function pointers, pointing to the concrete
piece of machine code for each method in the implementation. A method call like
`trait_object.method()` will retrieve the correct pointer out of the vtable and
then do a dynamic call of it. For example:

```rust
struct FooVtable {
    destructor: fn(*mut ()),
    size: usize,
    align: usize,
    method: fn(*const ()) -> String,
}

// u8:

fn call_method_on_u8(x: *const ()) -> String {
    // the compiler guarantees that this function is only called
    // with `x` pointing to a u8
    let byte: &u8 = unsafe { &*(x as *const u8) };

    byte.method()
}

static Foo_for_u8_vtable: FooVtable = FooVtable {
    destructor: /* compiler magic */,
    size: 1,
    align: 1,

    // cast to a function pointer
    method: call_method_on_u8 as fn(*const ()) -> String,
};


// String:

fn call_method_on_String(x: *const ()) -> String {
    // the compiler guarantees that this function is only called
    // with `x` pointing to a String
    let string: &String = unsafe { &*(x as *const String) };

    string.method()
}

static Foo_for_String_vtable: FooVtable = FooVtable {
    destructor: /* compiler magic */,
    // values for a 64-bit computer, halve them for 32-bit ones
    size: 24,
    align: 8,

    method: call_method_on_String as fn(*const ()) -> String,
};
```

The `destructor` field in each vtable points to a function that will clean up
any resources of the vtable’s type: for `u8` it is trivial, but for `String` it
will free the memory. This is necessary for owning trait objects like
`Box<Foo>`, which need to clean-up both the `Box` allocation as well as the
internal type when they go out of scope. The `size` and `align` fields store
the size of the erased type, and its alignment requirements; these are
essentially unused at the moment since the information is embedded in the
destructor, but will be used in the future, as trait objects are progressively
made more flexible.

Suppose we’ve got some values that implement `Foo`. The explicit form of
construction and use of `Foo` trait objects might look a bit like (ignoring the
type mismatches: they’re all pointers anyway):

```rust
let a: String = "foo".to_string();
let x: u8 = 1;

// let b: &Foo = &a;
let b = TraitObject {
    // store the data
    data: &a,
    // store the methods
    vtable: &Foo_for_String_vtable
};

// let y: &Foo = x;
let y = TraitObject {
    // store the data
    data: &x,
    // store the methods
    vtable: &Foo_for_u8_vtable
};

// b.method();
(b.vtable.method)(b.data);

// y.method();
(y.vtable.method)(y.data);
```

#### Object Safety

Not every trait can be used to make a trait object. For example, vectors implement
`Clone`, but if we try to make a trait object:

```ignore
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let o = &v as &Clone;
```

We get an error:

```text
error: cannot convert to a trait object because trait `core::clone::Clone` is not obje
↳ ct-safe [E0038]
let o = &v as &Clone;
        ^~
note: the trait cannot require that `Self : Sized`
let o = &v as &Clone;
        ^~
```

The error says that `Clone` is not ‘object-safe’. Only traits that are
object-safe can be made into trait objects. A trait is object-safe if both of
these are true:

* the trait does not require that `Self: Sized`
* all of its methods are object-safe

So what makes a method object-safe? Each method must require that `Self: Sized`
or all of the following:

* must not have any type parameters
* must not use `Self`

Whew! As we can see, almost all of these rules talk about `Self`. A good intuition
is “except in special circumstances, if your trait’s method uses `Self`, it is not
object-safe.”


## Closures {#sec--closures}


Sometimes it is useful to wrap up a function and _free variables_ for better
clarity and reuse. The free variables that can be used come from the
enclosing scope and are ‘closed over’ when used in the function. From this, we
get the name ‘closures’ and Rust provides a really great implementation of
them, as we’ll see.

### Syntax

Closures look like this:

```rust
let plus_one = |x: i32| x + 1;

assert_eq!(2, plus_one(1));
```

We create a binding, `plus_one`, and assign it to a closure. The closure’s
arguments go between the pipes (`|`), and the body is an expression, in this
case, `x + 1`. Remember that `{ }` is an expression, so we can have multi-line
closures too:

```rust
let plus_two = |x| {
    let mut result: i32 = x;

    result += 1;
    result += 1;

    result
};

assert_eq!(4, plus_two(2));
```

You’ll notice a few things about closures that are a bit different from regular
named functions defined with `fn`. The first is that we did not need to
annotate the types of arguments the closure takes or the values it returns. We
can:

```rust
let plus_one = |x: i32| -> i32 { x + 1 };

assert_eq!(2, plus_one(1));
```

But we don’t have to. Why is this? Basically, it was chosen for ergonomic
reasons. While specifying the full type for named functions is helpful with
things like documentation and type inference, the full type signatures of
closures are rarely documented since they’re anonymous, and they don’t cause
the kinds of error-at-a-distance problems that inferring named function types
can.

The second is that the syntax is similar, but a bit different. I’ve added
spaces here for easier comparison:

```rust
fn  plus_one_v1   (x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1 }
let plus_one_v2 = |x: i32| -> i32 { x + 1 };
let plus_one_v3 = |x: i32|          x + 1  ;
```

Small differences, but they’re similar.

### Closures and their environment

The environment for a closure can include bindings from its enclosing scope in
addition to parameters and local bindings. It looks like this:

```rust
let num = 5;
let plus_num = |x: i32| x + num;

assert_eq!(10, plus_num(5));
```

This closure, `plus_num`, refers to a `let` binding in its scope: `num`. More
specifically, it borrows the binding. If we do something that would conflict
with that binding, we get an error. Like this one:

```rust
let mut num = 5;
let plus_num = |x: i32| x + num;

let y = &mut num;
```

Which errors with:

```text
error: cannot borrow `num` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    let y = &mut num;
                 ^~~
note: previous borrow of `num` occurs here due to use in closure; the immutable
  borrow prevents subsequent moves or mutable borrows of `num` until the borrow
  ends
    let plus_num = |x| x + num;
                   ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: previous borrow ends here
fn main() {
    let mut num = 5;
    let plus_num = |x| x + num;

    let y = &mut num;
}
^
```

A verbose yet helpful error message! As it says, we can’t take a mutable borrow
on `num` because the closure is already borrowing it. If we let the closure go
out of scope, we can:

```rust
let mut num = 5;
{
    let plus_num = |x: i32| x + num;

} // plus_num goes out of scope, borrow of num ends

let y = &mut num;
```

If your closure requires it, however, Rust will take ownership and move
the environment instead. This doesn’t work:

```rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

let takes_nums = || nums;

println!("{:?}", nums);
```

We get this error:

```text
note: `nums` moved into closure environment here because it has type
  `[closure(()) -> collections::vec::Vec<i32>]`, which is non-copyable
let takes_nums = || nums;
                 ^~~~~~~
```

`Vec<T>` has ownership over its contents, and therefore, when we refer to it
in our closure, we have to take ownership of `nums`. It’s the same as if we’d
passed `nums` to a function that took ownership of it.

#### `move` closures

We can force our closure to take ownership of its environment with the `move`
keyword:

```rust
let num = 5;

let owns_num = move |x: i32| x + num;
```

Now, even though the keyword is `move`, the variables follow normal move semantics.
In this case, `5` implements `Copy`, and so `owns_num` takes ownership of a copy
of `num`. So what’s the difference?

```rust
let mut num = 5;

{
    let mut add_num = |x: i32| num += x;

    add_num(5);
}

assert_eq!(10, num);
```

So in this case, our closure took a mutable reference to `num`, and then when
we called `add_num`, it mutated the underlying value, as we’d expect. We also
needed to declare `add_num` as `mut` too, because we’re mutating its
environment.

If we change to a `move` closure, it’s different:

```rust
let mut num = 5;

{
    let mut add_num = move |x: i32| num += x;

    add_num(5);
}

assert_eq!(5, num);
```

We only get `5`. Rather than taking a mutable borrow out on our `num`, we took
ownership of a copy.

Another way to think about `move` closures: they give a closure its own stack
frame.  Without `move`, a closure may be tied to the stack frame that created
it, while a `move` closure is self-contained. This means that you cannot
generally return a non-`move` closure from a function, for example.

But before we talk about taking and returning closures, we should talk some
more about the way that closures are implemented. As a systems language, Rust
gives you tons of control over what your code does, and closures are no
different.

### Closure implementation

Rust’s implementation of closures is a bit different than other languages. They
are effectively syntax sugar for traits. You’ll want to make sure to have read
the [traits][closures.md--traits] section before this one, as well as the section on [trait
objects][closures.md--trait-objects].

[closures.md--traits]: #sec--traits
[closures.md--trait-objects]: #sec--trait-objects

Got all that? Good.

The key to understanding how closures work under the hood is something a bit
strange: Using `()` to call a function, like `foo()`, is an overloadable
operator. From this, everything else clicks into place. In Rust, we use the
trait system to overload operators. Calling functions is no different. We have
three separate traits to overload with:

```rust
pub trait Fn<Args> : FnMut<Args> {
    extern "rust-call" fn call(&self, args: Args) -> Self::Output;
}

pub trait FnMut<Args> : FnOnce<Args> {
    extern "rust-call" fn call_mut(&mut self, args: Args) -> Self::Output;
}

pub trait FnOnce<Args> {
    type Output;

    extern "rust-call" fn call_once(self, args: Args) -> Self::Output;
}
```

You’ll notice a few differences between these traits, but a big one is `self`:
`Fn` takes `&self`, `FnMut` takes `&mut self`, and `FnOnce` takes `self`. This
covers all three kinds of `self` via the usual method call syntax. But we’ve
split them up into three traits, rather than having a single one. This gives us
a large amount of control over what kind of closures we can take.

The `|| {}` syntax for closures is sugar for these three traits. Rust will
generate a struct for the environment, `impl` the appropriate trait, and then
use it.

### Taking closures as arguments

Now that we know that closures are traits, we already know how to accept and
return closures: the same as any other trait!

This also means that we can choose static vs dynamic dispatch as well. First,
let’s write a function which takes something callable, calls it, and returns
the result:

```rust
fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32
    where F : Fn(i32) -> i32 {

    some_closure(1)
}

let answer = call_with_one(|x| x + 2);

assert_eq!(3, answer);
```

We pass our closure, `|x| x + 2`, to `call_with_one`. It does what it
suggests: it calls the closure, giving it `1` as an argument.

Let’s examine the signature of `call_with_one` in more depth:

```rust
fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32
```

We take one parameter, and it has the type `F`. We also return a `i32`. This part
isn’t interesting. The next part is:

```rust
    where F : Fn(i32) -> i32 {
```

Because `Fn` is a trait, we can bound our generic with it. In this case, our
closure takes a `i32` as an argument and returns an `i32`, and so the generic
bound we use is `Fn(i32) -> i32`.

There’s one other key point here: because we’re bounding a generic with a
trait, this will get monomorphized, and therefore, we’ll be doing static
dispatch into the closure. That’s pretty neat. In many languages, closures are
inherently heap allocated, and will always involve dynamic dispatch. In Rust,
we can stack allocate our closure environment, and statically dispatch the
call. This happens quite often with iterators and their adapters, which often
take closures as arguments.

Of course, if we want dynamic dispatch, we can get that too. A trait object
handles this case, as usual:

```rust
fn call_with_one(some_closure: &Fn(i32) -> i32) -> i32 {
    some_closure(1)
}

let answer = call_with_one(&|x| x + 2);

assert_eq!(3, answer);
```

Now we take a trait object, a `&Fn`. And we have to make a reference
to our closure when we pass it to `call_with_one`, so we use `&||`.

### Function pointers and closures

A function pointer is kind of like a closure that has no environment. As such,
you can pass a function pointer to any function expecting a closure argument,
and it will work:

```rust
fn call_with_one(some_closure: &Fn(i32) -> i32) -> i32 {
    some_closure(1)
}

fn add_one(i: i32) -> i32 {
    i + 1
}

let f = add_one;

let answer = call_with_one(&f);

assert_eq!(2, answer);
```

In this example, we don’t strictly need the intermediate variable `f`,
the name of the function works just fine too:

```ignore
let answer = call_with_one(&add_one);
```

### Returning closures

It’s very common for functional-style code to return closures in various
situations. If you try to return a closure, you may run into an error. At
first, it may seem strange, but we’ll figure it out. Here’s how you’d probably
try to return a closure from a function:

```rust
fn factory() -> (Fn(i32) -> i32) {
    let num = 5;

    |x| x + num
}

let f = factory();

let answer = f(1);
assert_eq!(6, answer);
```

This gives us these long, related errors:

```text
error: the trait `core::marker::Sized` is not implemented for the type
`core::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32` [E0277]
fn factory() -> (Fn(i32) -> i32) {
                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
note: `core::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32` does not have a constant size known at compile-time
fn factory() -> (Fn(i32) -> i32) {
                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: the trait `core::marker::Sized` is not implemented for the type `core::ops::Fn(
↳ i32) -> i32` [E0277]
let f = factory();
    ^
note: `core::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32` does not have a constant size known at compile-time
let f = factory();
    ^
```

In order to return something from a function, Rust needs to know what
size the return type is. But since `Fn` is a trait, it could be various
things of various sizes: many different types can implement `Fn`. An easy
way to give something a size is to take a reference to it, as references
have a known size. So we’d write this:

```rust
fn factory() -> &(Fn(i32) -> i32) {
    let num = 5;

    |x| x + num
}

let f = factory();

let answer = f(1);
assert_eq!(6, answer);
```

But we get another error:

```text
error: missing lifetime specifier [E0106]
fn factory() -> &(Fn(i32) -> i32) {
                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Right. Because we have a reference, we need to give it a lifetime. But
our `factory()` function takes no arguments, so
[elision](#lifetime-elision) doesn’t kick in here. Then what
choices do we have? Try `'static`:

```rust
fn factory() -> &'static (Fn(i32) -> i32) {
    let num = 5;

    |x| x + num
}

let f = factory();

let answer = f(1);
assert_eq!(6, answer);
```

But we get another error:

```text
error: mismatched types:
 expected `&'static core::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32`,
    found `[closure@<anon>:7:9: 7:20]`
(expected &-ptr,
    found closure) [E0308]
         |x| x + num
         ^~~~~~~~~~~

```

This error is letting us know that we don’t have a `&'static Fn(i32) -> i32`,
we have a `[closure@<anon>:7:9: 7:20]`. Wait, what?

Because each closure generates its own environment `struct` and implementation
of `Fn` and friends, these types are anonymous. They exist solely for
this closure. So Rust shows them as `closure@<anon>`, rather than some
autogenerated name.

The error also points out that the return type is expected to be a reference,
but what we are trying to return is not. Further, we cannot directly assign a
`'static` lifetime to an object. So we'll take a different approach and return
a ‘trait object’ by `Box`ing up the `Fn`. This _almost_ works:

```rust
fn factory() -> Box<Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    let num = 5;

    Box::new(|x| x + num)
}
let f = factory();

let answer = f(1);
assert_eq!(6, answer);
```

There’s just one last problem:

```text
error: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `num`,
which is owned by the current function [E0373]
Box::new(|x| x + num)
         ^~~~~~~~~~~
```

Well, as we discussed before, closures borrow their environment. And in this
case, our environment is based on a stack-allocated `5`, the `num` variable
binding. So the borrow has a lifetime of the stack frame. So if we returned
this closure, the function call would be over, the stack frame would go away,
and our closure is capturing an environment of garbage memory! With one last
fix, we can make this work:

```rust
fn factory() -> Box<Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    let num = 5;

    Box::new(move |x| x + num)
}
let f = factory();

let answer = f(1);
assert_eq!(6, answer);
```

By making the inner closure a `move Fn`, we create a new stack frame for our
closure. By `Box`ing it up, we’ve given it a known size, and allowing it to
escape our stack frame.


## Universal Function Call Syntax {#sec--ufcs}


Sometimes, functions can have the same names. Consider this code:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn f(&self);
}

trait Bar {
    fn f(&self);
}

struct Baz;

impl Foo for Baz {
    fn f(&self) { println!("Baz’s impl of Foo"); }
}

impl Bar for Baz {
    fn f(&self) { println!("Baz’s impl of Bar"); }
}

let b = Baz;
```

If we were to try to call `b.f()`, we’d get an error:

```text
error: multiple applicable methods in scope [E0034]
b.f();
  ^~~
note: candidate #1 is defined in an impl of the trait `main::Foo` for the type
`main::Baz`
    fn f(&self) { println!("Baz’s impl of Foo"); }
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
note: candidate #2 is defined in an impl of the trait `main::Bar` for the type
`main::Baz`
    fn f(&self) { println!("Baz’s impl of Bar"); }
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```

We need a way to disambiguate which method we need. This feature is called
‘universal function call syntax’, and it looks like this:

```rust
Foo::f(&b);
Bar::f(&b);
```

Let’s break it down.

```rust
Foo::
Bar::
```

These halves of the invocation are the types of the two traits: `Foo` and
`Bar`. This is what ends up actually doing the disambiguation between the two:
Rust calls the one from the trait name you use.

```rust
f(&b)
```

When we call a method like `b.f()` using [method syntax][ufcs.md--methodsyntax], Rust
will automatically borrow `b` if `f()` takes `&self`. In this case, Rust will
not, and so we need to pass an explicit `&b`.

[ufcs.md--methodsyntax]: #sec--method-syntax

### Angle-bracket Form

The form of UFCS we just talked about:

```rust
Trait::method(args);
```

Is a short-hand. There’s an expanded form of this that’s needed in some
situations:

```rust
<Type as Trait>::method(args);
```

The `<>::` syntax is a means of providing a type hint. The type goes inside
the `<>`s. In this case, the type is `Type as Trait`, indicating that we want
`Trait`’s version of `method` to be called here. The `as Trait` part is
optional if it’s not ambiguous. Same with the angle brackets, hence the
shorter form.

Here’s an example of using the longer form.

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo() -> i32;
}

struct Bar;

impl Bar {
    fn foo() -> i32 {
        20
    }
}

impl Foo for Bar {
    fn foo() -> i32 {
        10
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(10, <Bar as Foo>::foo());
    assert_eq!(20, Bar::foo());
}
```

Using the angle bracket syntax lets you call the trait method instead of the
inherent one.


## Crates and Modules {#sec--crates-and-modules}


When a project starts getting large, it’s considered good software
engineering practice to split it up into a bunch of smaller pieces, and then
fit them together. It is also important to have a well-defined interface, so
that some of your functionality is private, and some is public. To facilitate
these kinds of things, Rust has a module system.

### Basic terminology: Crates and Modules

Rust has two distinct terms that relate to the module system: ‘crate’ and
‘module’. A crate is synonymous with a ‘library’ or ‘package’ in other
languages. Hence “Cargo” as the name of Rust’s package management tool: you
ship your crates to others with Cargo. Crates can produce an executable or a
library, depending on the project.

Each crate has an implicit *root module* that contains the code for that crate.
You can then define a tree of sub-modules under that root module. Modules allow
you to partition your code within the crate itself.

As an example, let’s make a *phrases* crate, which will give us various phrases
in different languages. To keep things simple, we’ll stick to ‘greetings’ and
‘farewells’ as two kinds of phrases, and use English and Japanese (日本語) as
two languages for those phrases to be in. We’ll use this module layout:

```text
                                    +-----------+
                                +---| greetings |
                                |   +-----------+
                  +---------+   |
              +---| english |---+
              |   +---------+   |   +-----------+
              |                 +---| farewells |
+---------+   |                     +-----------+
| phrases |---+
+---------+   |                     +-----------+
              |                 +---| greetings |
              |   +----------+  |   +-----------+
              +---| japanese |--+
                  +----------+  |
                                |   +-----------+
                                +---| farewells |
                                    +-----------+
```

In this example, `phrases` is the name of our crate. All of the rest are
modules.  You can see that they form a tree, branching out from the crate
*root*, which is the root of the tree: `phrases` itself.

Now that we have a plan, let’s define these modules in code. To start,
generate a new crate with Cargo:

```bash
$ cargo new phrases
$ cd phrases
```

If you remember, this generates a simple project for us:

```bash
$ tree .
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs

1 directory, 2 files
```

`src/lib.rs` is our crate root, corresponding to the `phrases` in our diagram
above.

### Defining Modules

To define each of our modules, we use the `mod` keyword. Let’s make our
`src/lib.rs` look like this:

```rust
mod english {
    mod greetings {
    }

    mod farewells {
    }
}

mod japanese {
    mod greetings {
    }

    mod farewells {
    }
}
```

After the `mod` keyword, you give the name of the module. Module names follow
the conventions for other Rust identifiers: `lower_snake_case`. The contents of
each module are within curly braces (`{}`).

Within a given `mod`, you can declare sub-`mod`s. We can refer to sub-modules
with double-colon (`::`) notation: our four nested modules are
`english::greetings`, `english::farewells`, `japanese::greetings`, and
`japanese::farewells`. Because these sub-modules are namespaced under their
parent module, the names don’t conflict: `english::greetings` and
`japanese::greetings` are distinct, even though their names are both
`greetings`.

Because this crate does not have a `main()` function, and is called `lib.rs`,
Cargo will build this crate as a library:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling phrases v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/phrases)
$ ls target/debug
build  deps  examples  libphrases-a7448e02a0468eaa.rlib  native
```

`libphrases-hash.rlib` is the compiled crate. Before we see how to use this
crate from another crate, let’s break it up into multiple files.

### Multiple file crates

If each crate were just one file, these files would get very large. It’s often
easier to split up crates into multiple files, and Rust supports this in two
ways.

Instead of declaring a module like this:

```rust
mod english {
    // contents of our module go here
}
```

We can instead declare our module like this:

```rust
mod english;
```

If we do that, Rust will expect to find either a `english.rs` file, or a
`english/mod.rs` file with the contents of our module.

Note that in these files, you don’t need to re-declare the module: that’s
already been done with the initial `mod` declaration.

Using these two techniques, we can break up our crate into two directories and
seven files:

```bash
$ tree .
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   ├── english
│   │   ├── farewells.rs
│   │   ├── greetings.rs
│   │   └── mod.rs
│   ├── japanese
│   │   ├── farewells.rs
│   │   ├── greetings.rs
│   │   └── mod.rs
│   └── lib.rs
└── target
    └── debug
        ├── build
        ├── deps
        ├── examples
        ├── libphrases-a7448e02a0468eaa.rlib
        └── native
```

`src/lib.rs` is our crate root, and looks like this:

```rust
mod english;
mod japanese;
```

These two declarations tell Rust to look for either `src/english.rs` and
`src/japanese.rs`, or `src/english/mod.rs` and `src/japanese/mod.rs`, depending
on our preference. In this case, because our modules have sub-modules, we’ve
chosen the second. Both `src/english/mod.rs` and `src/japanese/mod.rs` look
like this:

```rust
mod greetings;
mod farewells;
```

Again, these declarations tell Rust to look for either
`src/english/greetings.rs` and `src/japanese/greetings.rs` or
`src/english/farewells/mod.rs` and `src/japanese/farewells/mod.rs`. Because
these sub-modules don’t have their own sub-modules, we’ve chosen to make them
`src/english/greetings.rs` and `src/japanese/farewells.rs`. Whew!

The contents of `src/english/greetings.rs` and `src/japanese/farewells.rs` are
both empty at the moment. Let’s add some functions.

Put this in `src/english/greetings.rs`:

```rust
fn hello() -> String {
    "Hello!".to_string()
}
```

Put this in `src/english/farewells.rs`:

```rust
fn goodbye() -> String {
    "Goodbye.".to_string()
}
```

Put this in `src/japanese/greetings.rs`:

```rust
fn hello() -> String {
    "こんにちは".to_string()
}
```

Of course, you can copy and paste this from this web page, or type
something else. It’s not important that you actually put ‘konnichiwa’ to learn
about the module system.

Put this in `src/japanese/farewells.rs`:

```rust
fn goodbye() -> String {
    "さようなら".to_string()
}
```

(This is ‘Sayōnara’, if you’re curious.)

Now that we have some functionality in our crate, let’s try to use it from
another crate.

### Importing External Crates

We have a library crate. Let’s make an executable crate that imports and uses
our library.

Make a `src/main.rs` and put this in it (it won’t quite compile yet):

```rust
extern crate phrases;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", phrases::english::greetings::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in English: {}", phrases::english::farewells::goodbye());

    println!("Hello in Japanese: {}", phrases::japanese::greetings::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in Japanese: {}", phrases::japanese::farewells::goodbye());
}
```

The `extern crate` declaration tells Rust that we need to compile and link to
the `phrases` crate. We can then use `phrases`’ modules in this one. As we
mentioned earlier, you can use double colons to refer to sub-modules and the
functions inside of them.

(Note: when importing a crate that has dashes in its name "like-this", which is
not a valid Rust identifier, it will be converted by changing the dashes to
underscores, so you would write `extern crate like_this;`.)

Also, Cargo assumes that `src/main.rs` is the crate root of a binary crate,
rather than a library crate. Our package now has two crates: `src/lib.rs` and
`src/main.rs`. This pattern is quite common for executable crates: most
functionality is in a library crate, and the executable crate uses that
library. This way, other programs can also use the library crate, and it’s also
a nice separation of concerns.

This doesn’t quite work yet, though. We get four errors that look similar to
this:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling phrases v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/phrases)
src/main.rs:4:38: 4:72 error: function `hello` is private
src/main.rs:4     println!("Hello in English: {}", phrases::english::greetings::hello(
↳ ));
                                                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
note: in expansion of format_args!
<std macros>:2:25: 2:58 note: expansion site

<std macros>:1:1: 3:58 note: in expansion of println!
phrases/src/main.rs:4:5: 4:76 note: expansion site
```

By default, everything is private in Rust. Let’s talk about this in some more
depth.

### Exporting a Public Interface

Rust allows you to precisely control which aspects of your interface are
public, and so private is the default. To make things public, you use the `pub`
keyword. Let’s focus on the `english` module first, so let’s reduce our `src/main.rs`
to only this:

```rust
extern crate phrases;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", phrases::english::greetings::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in English: {}", phrases::english::farewells::goodbye());
}
```

In our `src/lib.rs`, let’s add `pub` to the `english` module declaration:

```rust
pub mod english;
mod japanese;
```

And in our `src/english/mod.rs`, let’s make both `pub`:

```rust
pub mod greetings;
pub mod farewells;
```

In our `src/english/greetings.rs`, let’s add `pub` to our `fn` declaration:

```rust
pub fn hello() -> String {
    "Hello!".to_string()
}
```

And also in `src/english/farewells.rs`:

```rust
pub fn goodbye() -> String {
    "Goodbye.".to_string()
}
```

Now, our crate compiles, albeit with warnings about not using the `japanese`
functions:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling phrases v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/phrases)
src/japanese/greetings.rs:1:1: 3:2 warning: function is never used: `hello`, #[warn(de
↳ ad_code)] on by default
src/japanese/greetings.rs:1 fn hello() -> String {
src/japanese/greetings.rs:2     "こんにちは".to_string()
src/japanese/greetings.rs:3 }
src/japanese/farewells.rs:1:1: 3:2 warning: function is never used: `goodbye`, #[warn(
↳ dead_code)] on by default
src/japanese/farewells.rs:1 fn goodbye() -> String {
src/japanese/farewells.rs:2     "さようなら".to_string()
src/japanese/farewells.rs:3 }
     Running `target/debug/phrases`
Hello in English: Hello!
Goodbye in English: Goodbye.
```

`pub` also applies to `struct`s and their member fields. In keeping with Rust’s
tendency toward safety, simply making a `struct` public won't automatically
make its members public: you must mark the fields individually with `pub`.

Now that our functions are public, we can use them. Great! However, typing out
`phrases::english::greetings::hello()` is very long and repetitive. Rust has
another keyword for importing names into the current scope, so that you can
refer to them with shorter names. Let’s talk about `use`.

### Importing Modules with `use`

Rust has a `use` keyword, which allows us to import names into our local scope.
Let’s change our `src/main.rs` to look like this:

```rust
extern crate phrases;

use phrases::english::greetings;
use phrases::english::farewells;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", greetings::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in English: {}", farewells::goodbye());
}
```

The two `use` lines import each module into the local scope, so we can refer to
the functions by a much shorter name. By convention, when importing functions, it’s
considered best practice to import the module, rather than the function directly. In
other words, you _can_ do this:

```rust
extern crate phrases;

use phrases::english::greetings::hello;
use phrases::english::farewells::goodbye;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", hello());
    println!("Goodbye in English: {}", goodbye());
}
```

But it is not idiomatic. This is significantly more likely to introduce a
naming conflict. In our short program, it’s not a big deal, but as it grows, it
becomes a problem. If we have conflicting names, Rust will give a compilation
error. For example, if we made the `japanese` functions public, and tried to do
this:

```rust
extern crate phrases;

use phrases::english::greetings::hello;
use phrases::japanese::greetings::hello;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", hello());
    println!("Hello in Japanese: {}", hello());
}
```

Rust will give us a compile-time error:

```text
   Compiling phrases v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/phrases)
src/main.rs:4:5: 4:40 error: a value named `hello` has already been imported in this m
↳ odule [E0252]
src/main.rs:4 use phrases::japanese::greetings::hello;
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `phrases`.
```

If we’re importing multiple names from the same module, we don’t have to type it out
twice. Instead of this:

```rust
use phrases::english::greetings;
use phrases::english::farewells;
```

We can use this shortcut:

```rust
use phrases::english::{greetings, farewells};
```

#### Re-exporting with `pub use`

You don’t only use `use` to shorten identifiers. You can also use it inside of your crate
to re-export a function inside another module. This allows you to present an external
interface that may not directly map to your internal code organization.

Let’s look at an example. Modify your `src/main.rs` to read like this:

```rust
extern crate phrases;

use phrases::english::{greetings,farewells};
use phrases::japanese;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", greetings::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in English: {}", farewells::goodbye());

    println!("Hello in Japanese: {}", japanese::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in Japanese: {}", japanese::goodbye());
}
```

Then, modify your `src/lib.rs` to make the `japanese` mod public:

```rust
pub mod english;
pub mod japanese;
```

Next, make the two functions public, first in `src/japanese/greetings.rs`:

```rust
pub fn hello() -> String {
    "こんにちは".to_string()
}
```

And then in `src/japanese/farewells.rs`:

```rust
pub fn goodbye() -> String {
    "さようなら".to_string()
}
```

Finally, modify your `src/japanese/mod.rs` to read like this:

```rust
pub use self::greetings::hello;
pub use self::farewells::goodbye;

mod greetings;
mod farewells;
```

The `pub use` declaration brings the function into scope at this part of our
module hierarchy. Because we’ve `pub use`d this inside of our `japanese`
module, we now have a `phrases::japanese::hello()` function and a
`phrases::japanese::goodbye()` function, even though the code for them lives in
`phrases::japanese::greetings::hello()` and
`phrases::japanese::farewells::goodbye()`. Our internal organization doesn’t
define our external interface.

Here we have a `pub use` for each function we want to bring into the
`japanese` scope. We could alternatively use the wildcard syntax to include
everything from `greetings` into the current scope: `pub use self::greetings::*`.

What about the `self`? Well, by default, `use` declarations are absolute paths,
starting from your crate root. `self` makes that path relative to your current
place in the hierarchy instead. There’s one more special form of `use`: you can
`use super::` to reach one level up the tree from your current location. Some
people like to think of `self` as `.` and `super` as `..`, from many shells’
display for the current directory and the parent directory.

Outside of `use`, paths are relative: `foo::bar()` refers to a function inside
of `foo` relative to where we are. If that’s prefixed with `::`, as in
`::foo::bar()`, it refers to a different `foo`, an absolute path from your
crate root.

This will build and run:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling phrases v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/phrases)
     Running `target/debug/phrases`
Hello in English: Hello!
Goodbye in English: Goodbye.
Hello in Japanese: こんにちは
Goodbye in Japanese: さようなら
```

#### Complex imports

Rust offers several advanced options that can add compactness and
convenience to your `extern crate` and `use` statements. Here is an example:

```rust
extern crate phrases as sayings;

use sayings::japanese::greetings as ja_greetings;
use sayings::japanese::farewells::*;
use sayings::english::{self, greetings as en_greetings, farewells as en_farewells};

fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English; {}", en_greetings::hello());
    println!("And in Japanese: {}", ja_greetings::hello());
    println!("Goodbye in English: {}", english::farewells::goodbye());
    println!("Again: {}", en_farewells::goodbye());
    println!("And in Japanese: {}", goodbye());
}
```

What's going on here?

First, both `extern crate` and `use` allow renaming the thing that is being
imported. So the crate is still called "phrases", but here we will refer
to it as "sayings". Similarly, the first `use` statement pulls in the
`japanese::greetings` module from the crate, but makes it available as
`ja_greetings` as opposed to simply `greetings`. This can help to avoid
ambiguity when importing similarly-named items from different places.

The second `use` statement uses a star glob to bring in all public symbols from
the `sayings::japanese::farewells` module. As you can see we can later refer to
the Japanese `goodbye` function with no module qualifiers. This kind of glob
should be used sparingly. It’s worth noting that it only imports the public
symbols, even if the code doing the globbing is in the same module.

The third `use` statement bears more explanation. It's using "brace expansion"
globbing to compress three `use` statements into one (this sort of syntax
may be familiar if you've written Linux shell scripts before). The
uncompressed form of this statement would be:

```rust
use sayings::english;
use sayings::english::greetings as en_greetings;
use sayings::english::farewells as en_farewells;
```

As you can see, the curly brackets compress `use` statements for several items
under the same path, and in this context `self` refers back to that path.
Note: The curly brackets cannot be nested or mixed with star globbing.


## `const` and `static` {#sec--const-and-static}


Rust has a way of defining constants with the `const` keyword:

```rust
const N: i32 = 5;
```

Unlike [`let`][const-and-static.md--let] bindings, you must annotate the type of a `const`.

[const-and-static.md--let]: #sec--variable-bindings

Constants live for the entire lifetime of a program. More specifically,
constants in Rust have no fixed address in memory. This is because they’re
effectively inlined to each place that they’re used. References to the same
constant are not necessarily guaranteed to refer to the same memory address for
this reason.

### `static`

Rust provides a ‘global variable’ sort of facility in static items. They’re
similar to constants, but static items aren’t inlined upon use. This means that
there is only one instance for each value, and it’s at a fixed location in
memory.

Here’s an example:

```rust
static N: i32 = 5;
```

Unlike [`let`][const-and-static.md--let] bindings, you must annotate the type of a `static`.

Statics live for the entire lifetime of a program, and therefore any
reference stored in a constant has a [`'static` lifetime][const-and-static.md--lifetimes]:

```rust
static NAME: &'static str = "Steve";
```

[const-and-static.md--lifetimes]: #sec--lifetimes

#### Mutability

You can introduce mutability with the `mut` keyword:

```rust
static mut N: i32 = 5;
```

Because this is mutable, one thread could be updating `N` while another is
reading it, causing memory unsafety. As such both accessing and mutating a
`static mut` is [`unsafe`][const-and-static.md--unsafe], and so must be done in an `unsafe` block:

```rust

unsafe {
    N += 1;

    println!("N: {}", N);
}
```

[const-and-static.md--unsafe]: #sec--unsafe

Furthermore, any type stored in a `static` must be `Sync`, and must not have
a [`Drop`][const-and-static.md--drop] implementation.

[const-and-static.md--drop]: #sec--drop

### Initializing

Both `const` and `static` have requirements for giving them a value. They must
be given a value that’s a constant expression. In other words, you cannot use 
the result of a function call or anything similarly complex or at runtime.

### Which construct should I use?

Almost always, if you can choose between the two, choose `const`. It’s pretty
rare that you actually want a memory location associated with your constant,
and using a const allows for optimizations like constant propagation not only
in your crate but downstream crates.


## Attributes {#sec--attributes}


Declarations can be annotated with ‘attributes’ in Rust. They look like this:

```rust
#[test]
```

or like this:

```rust
#![test]
```

The difference between the two is the `!`, which changes what the attribute
applies to:

```rust
#[foo]
struct Foo;

mod bar {
    #![bar]
}
```

The `#[foo]` attribute applies to the next item, which is the `struct`
declaration. The `#![bar]` attribute applies to the item enclosing it, which is
the `mod` declaration. Otherwise, they’re the same. Both change the meaning of
the item they’re attached to somehow.

For example, consider a function like this:

```rust
#[test]
fn check() {
    assert_eq!(2, 1 + 1);
}
```

It is marked with `#[test]`. This means it’s special: when you run
[tests][attributes.md--tests], this function will execute. When you compile as usual, it won’t
even be included. This function is now a test function.

[attributes.md--tests]: #sec--testing

Attributes may also have additional data:

```rust
#[inline(always)]
fn super_fast_fn() {
```

Or even keys and values:

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
mod macos_only {
```

Rust attributes are used for a number of different things. There is a full list
of attributes [in the reference][attributes.md--reference]. Currently, you are not allowed to
create your own attributes, the Rust compiler defines them.

[attributes.md--reference]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#attributes


## `type` aliases {#sec--type-aliases}


The `type` keyword lets you declare an alias of another type:

```rust
type Name = String;
```

You can then use this type as if it were a real type:

```rust
type Name = String;

let x: Name = "Hello".to_string();
```

Note, however, that this is an _alias_, not a new type entirely. In other
words, because Rust is strongly typed, you’d expect a comparison between two
different types to fail:

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
let y: i64 = 5;

if x == y {
   // ...
}
```

this gives

```text
error: mismatched types:
 expected `i32`,
    found `i64`
(expected i32,
    found i64) [E0308]
     if x == y {
             ^
```

But, if we had an alias:

```rust
type Num = i32;

let x: i32 = 5;
let y: Num = 5;

if x == y {
   // ...
}
```

This compiles without error. Values of a `Num` type are the same as a value of
type `i32`, in every way. You can use [tuple struct] to really get a new type.

[type-aliases.md--tuple struct]: #tuple-structs

You can also use type aliases with generics:

```rust
use std::result;

enum ConcreteError {
    Foo,
    Bar,
}

type Result<T> = result::Result<T, ConcreteError>;
```

This creates a specialized version of the `Result` type, which always has a
`ConcreteError` for the `E` part of `Result<T, E>`. This is commonly used
in the standard library to create custom errors for each subsection. For
example, [io::Result][type-aliases.md--ioresult].

[type-aliases.md--ioresult]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html


## Casting between types {#sec--casting-between-types}


Rust, with its focus on safety, provides two different ways of casting
different types between each other. The first, `as`, is for safe casts.
In contrast, `transmute` allows for arbitrary casting, and is one of the
most dangerous features of Rust!

### Coercion

Coercion between types is implicit and has no syntax of its own, but can
be spelled out with [`as`](#explicit-coercions).

Coercion occurs in `let`, `const`, and `static` statements; in
function call arguments; in field values in struct initialization; and in a
function result.

The most common case of coercion is removing mutability from a reference:

 * `&mut T` to `&T`
 
An analogous conversion is to remove mutability from a
[raw pointer](raw-pointers.md):

 * `*mut T` to `*const T`
 
References can also be coerced to raw pointers:

 * `&T` to `*const T`

 * `&mut T` to `*mut T`

Custom coercions may be defined using [`Deref`](deref-coercions.md).

Coercion is transitive.
 
### `as`

The `as` keyword does safe casting:

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;

let y = x as i64;
```

There are three major categories of safe cast: explicit coercions, casts
between numeric types, and pointer casts.

Casting is not transitive: even if `e as U1 as U2` is a valid
expression, `e as U2` is not necessarily so (in fact it will only be valid if
`U1` coerces to `U2`).


#### Explicit coercions

A cast `e as U` is valid if `e` has type `T` and `T` *coerces* to `U`.

#### Numeric casts

A cast `e as U` is also valid in any of the following cases:

 * `e` has type `T` and `T` and `U` are any numeric types; *numeric-cast*
 * `e` is a C-like enum (with no data attached to the variants),
    and `U` is an integer type; *enum-cast*
 * `e` has type `bool` or `char` and `U` is an integer type; *prim-int-cast*
 * `e` has type `u8` and `U` is `char`; *u8-char-cast*
 
For example

```rust
let one = true as u8;
let at_sign = 64 as char;
let two_hundred = -56i8 as u8;
```

The semantics of numeric casts are:

* Casting between two integers of the same size (e.g. i32 -> u32) is a no-op
* Casting from a larger integer to a smaller integer (e.g. u32 -> u8) will
  truncate
* Casting from a smaller integer to a larger integer (e.g. u8 -> u32) will
    * zero-extend if the source is unsigned
    * sign-extend if the source is signed
* Casting from a float to an integer will round the float towards zero
    * **[NOTE: currently this will cause Undefined Behavior if the rounded
      value cannot be represented by the target integer type][casting-between-types.md--float-int]**.
      This includes Inf and NaN. This is a bug and will be fixed.
* Casting from an integer to float will produce the floating point
  representation of the integer, rounded if necessary (rounding strategy
  unspecified)
* Casting from an f32 to an f64 is perfect and lossless
* Casting from an f64 to an f32 will produce the closest possible value
  (rounding strategy unspecified)
    * **[NOTE: currently this will cause Undefined Behavior if the value
      is finite but larger or smaller than the largest or smallest finite
      value representable by f32][casting-between-types.md--float-float]**. This is a bug and will
      be fixed.

[casting-between-types.md--float-int]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10184
[casting-between-types.md--float-float]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15536
 
#### Pointer casts
 
Perhaps surprisingly, it is safe to cast [raw pointers](raw-pointers.md) to and
from integers, and to cast between pointers to different types subject to
some constraints. It is only unsafe to dereference the pointer:

```rust
let a = 300 as *const char; // a pointer to location 300
let b = a as u32;
```

`e as U` is a valid pointer cast in any of the following cases:

* `e` has type `*T`, `U` has type `*U_0`, and either `U_0: Sized` or
  `unsize_kind(T) == unsize_kind(U_0)`; a *ptr-ptr-cast*
  
* `e` has type `*T` and `U` is a numeric type, while `T: Sized`; *ptr-addr-cast*

* `e` is an integer and `U` is `*U_0`, while `U_0: Sized`; *addr-ptr-cast*

* `e` has type `&[T; n]` and `U` is `*const T`; *array-ptr-cast*

* `e` is a function pointer type and `U` has type `*T`,
  while `T: Sized`; *fptr-ptr-cast*

* `e` is a function pointer type and `U` is an integer; *fptr-addr-cast*


### `transmute`

`as` only allows safe casting, and will for example reject an attempt to
cast four bytes into a `u32`:

```rust
let a = [0u8, 0u8, 0u8, 0u8];

let b = a as u32; // four eights makes 32
```

This errors with:

```text
error: non-scalar cast: `[u8; 4]` as `u32`
let b = a as u32; // four eights makes 32
        ^~~~~~~~
```

This is a ‘non-scalar cast’ because we have multiple values here: the four
elements of the array. These kinds of casts are very dangerous, because they
make assumptions about the way that multiple underlying structures are
implemented. For this, we need something more dangerous.

The `transmute` function is provided by a [compiler intrinsic][casting-between-types.md--intrinsics], and
what it does is very simple, but very scary. It tells Rust to treat a value of
one type as though it were another type. It does this regardless of the
typechecking system, and completely trusts you.

[casting-between-types.md--intrinsics]: #sec--intrinsics

In our previous example, we know that an array of four `u8`s represents a `u32`
properly, and so we want to do the cast. Using `transmute` instead of `as`,
Rust lets us:

```rust
use std::mem;

unsafe {
    let a = [0u8, 0u8, 0u8, 0u8];

    let b = mem::transmute::<[u8; 4], u32>(a);
}
```

We have to wrap the operation in an `unsafe` block for this to compile
successfully. Technically, only the `mem::transmute` call itself needs to be in
the block, but it's nice in this case to enclose everything related, so you
know where to look. In this case, the details about `a` are also important, and
so they're in the block. You'll see code in either style, sometimes the context
is too far away, and wrapping all of the code in `unsafe` isn't a great idea.

While `transmute` does very little checking, it will at least make sure that
the types are the same size. This errors:

```rust
use std::mem;

unsafe {
    let a = [0u8, 0u8, 0u8, 0u8];

    let b = mem::transmute::<[u8; 4], u64>(a);
}
```

with:

```text
error: transmute called with differently sized types: [u8; 4] (32 bits) to u64
(64 bits)
```

Other than that, you're on your own!


## Associated Types {#sec--associated-types}


Associated types are a powerful part of Rust’s type system. They’re related to
the idea of a ‘type family’, in other words, grouping multiple types together. That
description is a bit abstract, so let’s dive right into an example. If you want
to write a `Graph` trait, you have two types to be generic over: the node type
and the edge type. So you might write a trait, `Graph<N, E>`, that looks like
this:

```rust
trait Graph<N, E> {
    fn has_edge(&self, &N, &N) -> bool;
    fn edges(&self, &N) -> Vec<E>;
    // etc
}
```

While this sort of works, it ends up being awkward. For example, any function
that wants to take a `Graph` as a parameter now _also_ needs to be generic over
the `N`ode and `E`dge types too:

```rust
fn distance<N, E, G: Graph<N, E>>(graph: &G, start: &N, end: &N) -> u32 { ... }
```

Our distance calculation works regardless of our `Edge` type, so the `E` stuff in
this signature is a distraction.

What we really want to say is that a certain `E`dge and `N`ode type come together
to form each kind of `Graph`. We can do that with associated types:

```rust
trait Graph {
    type N;
    type E;

    fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;
    fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;
    // etc
}
```

Now, our clients can be abstract over a given `Graph`:

```rust
fn distance<G: Graph>(graph: &G, start: &G::N, end: &G::N) -> u32 { ... }
```

No need to deal with the `E`dge type here!

Let’s go over all this in more detail.

#### Defining associated types

Let’s build that `Graph` trait. Here’s the definition:

```rust
trait Graph {
    type N;
    type E;

    fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;
    fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;
}
```

Simple enough. Associated types use the `type` keyword, and go inside the body
of the trait, with the functions.

These `type` declarations can have all the same thing as functions do. For example,
if we wanted our `N` type to implement `Display`, so we can print the nodes out,
we could do this:

```rust
use std::fmt;

trait Graph {
    type N: fmt::Display;
    type E;

    fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;
    fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;
}
```

#### Implementing associated types

Just like any trait, traits that use associated types use the `impl` keyword to
provide implementations. Here’s a simple implementation of Graph:

```rust
struct Node;

struct Edge;

struct MyGraph;

impl Graph for MyGraph {
    type N = Node;
    type E = Edge;

    fn has_edge(&self, n1: &Node, n2: &Node) -> bool {
        true
    }

    fn edges(&self, n: &Node) -> Vec<Edge> {
        Vec::new()
    }
}
```

This silly implementation always returns `true` and an empty `Vec<Edge>`, but it
gives you an idea of how to implement this kind of thing. We first need three
`struct`s, one for the graph, one for the node, and one for the edge. If it made
more sense to use a different type, that would work as well, we’re going to
use `struct`s for all three here.

Next is the `impl` line, which is an implementation like any other trait.

From here, we use `=` to define our associated types. The name the trait uses
goes on the left of the `=`, and the concrete type we’re `impl`ementing this
for goes on the right. Finally, we use the concrete types in our function
declarations.

#### Trait objects with associated types

There’s one more bit of syntax we should talk about: trait objects. If you
try to create a trait object from an associated type, like this:

```rust
let graph = MyGraph;
let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph>;
```

You’ll get two errors:

```text
error: the value of the associated type `E` (from the trait `main::Graph`) must
be specified [E0191]
let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph>;
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
24:44 error: the value of the associated type `N` (from the trait
`main::Graph`) must be specified [E0191]
let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph>;
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

We can’t create a trait object like this, because we don’t know the associated
types. Instead, we can write this:

```rust
let graph = MyGraph;
let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph<N=Node, E=Edge>>;
```

The `N=Node` syntax allows us to provide a concrete type, `Node`, for the `N`
type parameter. Same with `E=Edge`. If we didn’t provide this constraint, we
couldn’t be sure which `impl` to match this trait object to.


## Unsized Types {#sec--unsized-types}


Most types have a particular size, in bytes, that is knowable at compile time.
For example, an `i32` is thirty-two bits big, or four bytes. However, there are
some types which are useful to express, but do not have a defined size. These are
called ‘unsized’ or ‘dynamically sized’ types. One example is `[T]`. This type
represents a certain number of `T` in sequence. But we don’t know how many
there are, so the size is not known.

Rust understands a few of these types, but they have some restrictions. There
are three:

1. We can only manipulate an instance of an unsized type via a pointer. An
   `&[T]` works fine, but a `[T]` does not.
2. Variables and arguments cannot have dynamically sized types.
3. Only the last field in a `struct` may have a dynamically sized type; the
   other fields must not. Enum variants must not have dynamically sized types as
   data.

So why bother? Well, because `[T]` can only be used behind a pointer, if we
didn’t have language support for unsized types, it would be impossible to write
this:

```rust
impl Foo for str {
```

or

```rust
impl<T> Foo for [T] {
```

Instead, you would have to write:

```rust
impl Foo for &str {
```

Meaning, this implementation would only work for [references][unsized-types.md--ref], and not
other types of pointers. With the `impl for str`, all pointers, including (at
some point, there are some bugs to fix first) user-defined custom smart
pointers, can use this `impl`.

[unsized-types.md--ref]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

### ?Sized

If you want to write a function that accepts a dynamically sized type, you
can use the special bound, `?Sized`:

```rust
struct Foo<T: ?Sized> {
    f: T,
}
```

This `?`, read as “T may be `Sized`”,  means that this bound is special: it
lets us match more kinds, not less. It’s almost like every `T` implicitly has
`T: Sized`, and the `?` undoes this default.


## Operators and Overloading {#sec--operators-and-overloading}


Rust allows for a limited form of operator overloading. There are certain
operators that are able to be overloaded. To support a particular operator
between types, there’s a specific trait that you can implement, which then
overloads the operator.

For example, the `+` operator can be overloaded with the `Add` trait:

```rust
use std::ops::Add;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;

    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {
        Point { x: self.x + other.x, y: self.y + other.y }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 1, y: 0 };
    let p2 = Point { x: 2, y: 3 };

    let p3 = p1 + p2;

    println!("{:?}", p3);
}
```

In `main`, we can use `+` on our two `Point`s, since we’ve implemented
`Add<Output=Point>` for `Point`.

There are a number of operators that can be overloaded this way, and all of
their associated traits live in the [`std::ops`][operators-and-overloading.md--stdops] module. Check out its
documentation for the full list.

[operators-and-overloading.md--stdops]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/index.html

Implementing these traits follows a pattern. Let’s look at [`Add`][operators-and-overloading.md--add] in more
detail:

```rust
pub trait Add<RHS = Self> {
    type Output;

    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -> Self::Output;
}
```

[operators-and-overloading.md--add]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Add.html

There’s three types in total involved here: the type you `impl Add` for, `RHS`,
which defaults to `Self`, and `Output`. For an expression `let z = x + y`, `x`
is the `Self` type, `y` is the RHS, and `z` is the `Self::Output` type.

```rust
impl Add<i32> for Point {
    type Output = f64;

    fn add(self, rhs: i32) -> f64 {
        // add an i32 to a Point and get an f64
    }
}
```

will let you do this:

```rust
let p: Point = // ...
let x: f64 = p + 2i32;
```

### Using operator traits in generic structs

Now that we know how operator traits are defined, we can define our `HasArea`
trait and `Square` struct from the [traits chapter][operators-and-overloading.md--traits] more generically:

[operators-and-overloading.md--traits]: #sec--traits

```rust
use std::ops::Mul;

trait HasArea<T> {
    fn area(&self) -> T;
}

struct Square<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
    side: T,
}

impl<T> HasArea<T> for Square<T>
        where T: Mul<Output=T> + Copy {
    fn area(&self) -> T {
        self.side * self.side
    }
}

fn main() {
    let s = Square {
        x: 0.0f64,
        y: 0.0f64,
        side: 12.0f64,
    };

    println!("Area of s: {}", s.area());
}
```

For `HasArea` and `Square`, we declare a type parameter `T` and replace
`f64` with it. The `impl` needs more involved modifications:

```ignore
impl<T> HasArea<T> for Square<T>
        where T: Mul<Output=T> + Copy { ... }
```

The `area` method requires that we can multiply the sides, so we declare that
type `T` must implement `std::ops::Mul`. Like `Add`, mentioned above, `Mul`
itself takes an `Output` parameter: since we know that numbers don't change
type when multiplied, we also set it to `T`. `T` must also support copying, so
Rust doesn't try to move `self.side` into the return value.


## Deref coercions {#sec--deref-coercions}


The standard library provides a special trait, [`Deref`][deref-coercions.md--deref]. It’s normally
used to overload `*`, the dereference operator:

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

struct DerefExample<T> {
    value: T,
}

impl<T> Deref for DerefExample<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &self.value
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = DerefExample { value: 'a' };
    assert_eq!('a', *x);
}
```

[deref-coercions.md--deref]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html

This is useful for writing custom pointer types. However, there’s a language
feature related to `Deref`: ‘deref coercions’. Here’s the rule: If you have a
type `U`, and it implements `Deref<Target=T>`, values of `&U` will
automatically coerce to a `&T`. Here’s an example:

```rust
fn foo(s: &str) {
    // borrow a string for a second
}

// String implements Deref<Target=str>
let owned = "Hello".to_string();

// therefore, this works:
foo(&owned);
```

Using an ampersand in front of a value takes a reference to it. So `owned` is a
`String`, `&owned` is an `&String`, and since `impl Deref<Target=str> for
String`, `&String` will deref to `&str`, which `foo()` takes.

That’s it. This rule is one of the only places in which Rust does an automatic
conversion for you, but it adds a lot of flexibility. For example, the `Rc<T>`
type implements `Deref<Target=T>`, so this works:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn foo(s: &str) {
    // borrow a string for a second
}

// String implements Deref<Target=str>
let owned = "Hello".to_string();
let counted = Rc::new(owned);

// therefore, this works:
foo(&counted);
```

All we’ve done is wrap our `String` in an `Rc<T>`. But we can now pass the
`Rc<String>` around anywhere we’d have a `String`. The signature of `foo`
didn’t change, but works just as well with either type. This example has two
conversions: `Rc<String>` to `String` and then `String` to `&str`. Rust will do
this as many times as possible until the types match.

Another very common implementation provided by the standard library is:

```rust
fn foo(s: &[i32]) {
    // borrow a slice for a second
}

// Vec<T> implements Deref<Target=[T]>
let owned = vec![1, 2, 3];

foo(&owned);
```

Vectors can `Deref` to a slice.

#### Deref and method calls

`Deref` will also kick in when calling a method. Consider the following
example.

```rust
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn foo(&self) { println!("Foo"); }
}

let f = &&Foo;

f.foo();
```

Even though `f` is a `&&Foo` and `foo` takes `&self`, this works. That’s
because these things are the same:

```rust
f.foo();
(&f).foo();
(&&f).foo();
(&&&&&&&&f).foo();
```

A value of type `&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Foo` can still have methods defined on `Foo`
called, because the compiler will insert as many * operations as necessary to
get it right. And since it’s inserting `*`s, that uses `Deref`.


## Macros {#sec--macros}


By now you’ve learned about many of the tools Rust provides for abstracting and
reusing code. These units of code reuse have a rich semantic structure. For
example, functions have a type signature, type parameters have trait bounds,
and overloaded functions must belong to a particular trait.

This structure means that Rust’s core abstractions have powerful compile-time
correctness checking. But this comes at the price of reduced flexibility. If
you visually identify a pattern of repeated code, you may find it’s difficult
or cumbersome to express that pattern as a generic function, a trait, or
anything else within Rust’s semantics.

Macros allow us to abstract at a syntactic level. A macro invocation is
shorthand for an "expanded" syntactic form. This expansion happens early in
compilation, before any static checking. As a result, macros can capture many
patterns of code reuse that Rust’s core abstractions cannot.

The drawback is that macro-based code can be harder to understand, because
fewer of the built-in rules apply. Like an ordinary function, a well-behaved
macro can be used without understanding its implementation. However, it can be
difficult to design a well-behaved macro!  Additionally, compiler errors in
macro code are harder to interpret, because they describe problems in the
expanded code, not the source-level form that developers use.

These drawbacks make macros something of a "feature of last resort". That’s not
to say that macros are bad; they are part of Rust because sometimes they’re
needed for truly concise, well-abstracted code. Just keep this tradeoff in
mind.

### Defining a macro

You may have seen the `vec!` macro, used to initialize a [vector][macros.md--vector] with
any number of elements.

[macros.md--vector]: #sec--vectors

```rust
let x: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

This can’t be an ordinary function, because it takes any number of arguments.
But we can imagine it as syntactic shorthand for

```rust
let x: Vec<u32> = {
    let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
    temp_vec.push(1);
    temp_vec.push(2);
    temp_vec.push(3);
    temp_vec
};
```

We can implement this shorthand, using a macro: [^macros.md--actual]

[^macros.md--actual]: The actual definition of `vec!` in libcollections differs from the
           one presented here, for reasons of efficiency and reusability.

```rust
macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}
```

Whoa, that’s a lot of new syntax! Let’s break it down.

```ignore
macro_rules! vec { ... }
```

This says we’re defining a macro named `vec`, much as `fn vec` would define a
function named `vec`. In prose, we informally write a macro’s name with an
exclamation point, e.g. `vec!`. The exclamation point is part of the invocation
syntax and serves to distinguish a macro from an ordinary function.

#### Matching

The macro is defined through a series of rules, which are pattern-matching
cases. Above, we had

```ignore
( $( $x:expr ),* ) => { ... };
```

This is like a `match` expression arm, but the matching happens on Rust syntax
trees, at compile time. The semicolon is optional on the last (here, only)
case. The "pattern" on the left-hand side of `=>` is known as a ‘matcher’.
These have [their own little grammar] within the language.

[macros.md--their own little grammar]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#macros

The matcher `$x:expr` will match any Rust expression, binding that syntax tree
to the ‘metavariable’ `$x`. The identifier `expr` is a ‘fragment specifier’;
the full possibilities are enumerated later in this chapter.
Surrounding the matcher with `$(...),*` will match zero or more expressions,
separated by commas.

Aside from the special matcher syntax, any Rust tokens that appear in a matcher
must match exactly. For example,

```rust
macro_rules! foo {
    (x => $e:expr) => (println!("mode X: {}", $e));
    (y => $e:expr) => (println!("mode Y: {}", $e));
}

fn main() {
    foo!(y => 3);
}
```

will print

```text
mode Y: 3
```

With

```rust
foo!(z => 3);
```

we get the compiler error

```text
error: no rules expected the token `z`
```

#### Expansion

The right-hand side of a macro rule is ordinary Rust syntax, for the most part.
But we can splice in bits of syntax captured by the matcher. From the original
example:

```ignore
$(
    temp_vec.push($x);
)*
```

Each matched expression `$x` will produce a single `push` statement in the
macro expansion. The repetition in the expansion proceeds in "lockstep" with
repetition in the matcher (more on this in a moment).

Because `$x` was already declared as matching an expression, we don’t repeat
`:expr` on the right-hand side. Also, we don’t include a separating comma as
part of the repetition operator. Instead, we have a terminating semicolon
within the repeated block.

Another detail: the `vec!` macro has *two* pairs of braces on the right-hand
side. They are often combined like so:

```ignore
macro_rules! foo {
    () => {{
        ...
    }}
}
```

The outer braces are part of the syntax of `macro_rules!`. In fact, you can use
`()` or `[]` instead. They simply delimit the right-hand side as a whole.

The inner braces are part of the expanded syntax. Remember, the `vec!` macro is
used in an expression context. To write an expression with multiple statements,
including `let`-bindings, we use a block. If your macro expands to a single
expression, you don’t need this extra layer of braces.

Note that we never *declared* that the macro produces an expression. In fact,
this is not determined until we use the macro as an expression. With care, you
can write a macro whose expansion works in several contexts. For example,
shorthand for a data type could be valid as either an expression or a pattern.

#### Repetition

The repetition operator follows two principal rules:

1. `$(...)*` walks through one "layer" of repetitions, for all of the `$name`s
   it contains, in lockstep, and
2. each `$name` must be under at least as many `$(...)*`s as it was matched
   against. If it is under more, it’ll be duplicated, as appropriate.

This baroque macro illustrates the duplication of variables from outer
repetition levels.

```rust
macro_rules! o_O {
    (
        $(
            $x:expr; [ $( $y:expr ),* ]
        );*
    ) => {
        &[ $($( $x + $y ),*),* ]
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a: &[i32]
        = o_O!(10; [1, 2, 3];
               20; [4, 5, 6]);

    assert_eq!(a, [11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26]);
}
```

That’s most of the matcher syntax. These examples use `$(...)*`, which is a
"zero or more" match. Alternatively you can write `$(...)+` for a "one or
more" match. Both forms optionally include a separator, which can be any token
except `+` or `*`.

This system is based on
"[Macro-by-Example](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/ftp/techreports/TR206.pdf)"
(PDF link).

### Hygiene

Some languages implement macros using simple text substitution, which leads to
various problems. For example, this C program prints `13` instead of the
expected `25`.

```text
#define FIVE_TIMES(x) 5 * x

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", FIVE_TIMES(2 + 3));
    return 0;
}
```

After expansion we have `5 * 2 + 3`, and multiplication has greater precedence
than addition. If you’ve used C macros a lot, you probably know the standard
idioms for avoiding this problem, as well as five or six others. In Rust, we
don’t have to worry about it.

```rust
macro_rules! five_times {
    ($x:expr) => (5 * $x);
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(25, five_times!(2 + 3));
}
```

The metavariable `$x` is parsed as a single expression node, and keeps its
place in the syntax tree even after substitution.

Another common problem in macro systems is ‘variable capture’. Here’s a C
macro, using [a GNU C extension] to emulate Rust’s expression blocks.

[macros.md--a GNU C extension]: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html

```text
#define LOG(msg) ({ \
    int state = get_log_state(); \
    if (state > 0) { \
        printf("log(%d): %s\n", state, msg); \
    } \
})
```

Here’s a simple use case that goes terribly wrong:

```text
const char *state = "reticulating splines";
LOG(state)
```

This expands to

```text
const char *state = "reticulating splines";
{
    int state = get_log_state();
    if (state > 0) {
        printf("log(%d): %s\n", state, state);
    }
}
```

The second variable named `state` shadows the first one.  This is a problem
because the print statement should refer to both of them.

The equivalent Rust macro has the desired behavior.

```rust
macro_rules! log {
    ($msg:expr) => {{
        let state: i32 = get_log_state();
        if state > 0 {
            println!("log({}): {}", state, $msg);
        }
    }};
}

fn main() {
    let state: &str = "reticulating splines";
    log!(state);
}
```

This works because Rust has a [hygienic macro system]. Each macro expansion
happens in a distinct ‘syntax context’, and each variable is tagged with the
syntax context where it was introduced. It’s as though the variable `state`
inside `main` is painted a different "color" from the variable `state` inside
the macro, and therefore they don’t conflict.

[macros.md--hygienic macro system]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro

This also restricts the ability of macros to introduce new bindings at the
invocation site. Code such as the following will not work:

```rust
macro_rules! foo {
    () => (let x = 3);
}

fn main() {
    foo!();
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

Instead you need to pass the variable name into the invocation, so it’s tagged
with the right syntax context.

```rust
macro_rules! foo {
    ($v:ident) => (let $v = 3);
}

fn main() {
    foo!(x);
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

This holds for `let` bindings and loop labels, but not for [items][macros.md--items].
So the following code does compile:

```rust
macro_rules! foo {
    () => (fn x() { });
}

fn main() {
    foo!();
    x();
}
```

### Recursive macros

A macro’s expansion can include more macro invocations, including invocations
of the very same macro being expanded.  These recursive macros are useful for
processing tree-structured input, as illustrated by this (simplistic) HTML
shorthand:

```rust
macro_rules! write_html {
    ($w:expr, ) => (());

    ($w:expr, $e:tt) => (write!($w, "{}", $e));

    ($w:expr, $tag:ident [ $($inner:tt)* ] $($rest:tt)*) => {{
        write!($w, "<{}>", stringify!($tag));
        write_html!($w, $($inner)*);
        write!($w, "</{}>", stringify!($tag));
        write_html!($w, $($rest)*);
    }};
}

fn main() {
    use std::fmt::Write;
    let mut out = String::new();

    write_html!(&mut out,
        html[
            head[title["Macros guide"]]
            body[h1["Macros are the best!"]]
        ]);

    assert_eq!(out,
        "<html><head><title>Macros guide</title></head>\
         <body><h1>Macros are the best!</h1></body></html>");
}
```

### Debugging macro code

To see the results of expanding macros, run `rustc --pretty expanded`. The
output represents a whole crate, so you can also feed it back in to `rustc`,
which will sometimes produce better error messages than the original
compilation. Note that the `--pretty expanded` output may have a different
meaning if multiple variables of the same name (but different syntax contexts)
are in play in the same scope. In this case `--pretty expanded,hygiene` will
tell you about the syntax contexts.

`rustc` provides two syntax extensions that help with macro debugging. For now,
they are unstable and require feature gates.

* `log_syntax!(...)` will print its arguments to standard output, at compile
  time, and "expand" to nothing.

* `trace_macros!(true)` will enable a compiler message every time a macro is
  expanded. Use `trace_macros!(false)` later in expansion to turn it off.

### Syntactic requirements

Even when Rust code contains un-expanded macros, it can be parsed as a full
[syntax tree][macros.md--ast]. This property can be very useful for editors and other
tools that process code. It also has a few consequences for the design of
Rust’s macro system.

[macros.md--ast]: #abstract-syntax-tree

One consequence is that Rust must determine, when it parses a macro invocation,
whether the macro stands in for

* zero or more items,
* zero or more methods,
* an expression,
* a statement, or
* a pattern.

A macro invocation within a block could stand for some items, or for an
expression / statement. Rust uses a simple rule to resolve this ambiguity. A
macro invocation that stands for items must be either

* delimited by curly braces, e.g. `foo! { ... }`, or
* terminated by a semicolon, e.g. `foo!(...);`

Another consequence of pre-expansion parsing is that the macro invocation must
consist of valid Rust tokens. Furthermore, parentheses, brackets, and braces
must be balanced within a macro invocation. For example, `foo!([)` is
forbidden. This allows Rust to know where the macro invocation ends.

More formally, the macro invocation body must be a sequence of ‘token trees’.
A token tree is defined recursively as either

* a sequence of token trees surrounded by matching `()`, `[]`, or `{}`, or
* any other single token.

Within a matcher, each metavariable has a ‘fragment specifier’, identifying
which syntactic form it matches.

* `ident`: an identifier. Examples: `x`; `foo`.
* `path`: a qualified name. Example: `T::SpecialA`.
* `expr`: an expression. Examples: `2 + 2`; `if true { 1 } else { 2 }`; `f(42)`.
* `ty`: a type. Examples: `i32`; `Vec<(char, String)>`; `&T`.
* `pat`: a pattern. Examples: `Some(t)`; `(17, 'a')`; `_`.
* `stmt`: a single statement. Example: `let x = 3`.
* `block`: a brace-delimited sequence of statements. Example:
  `{ log(error, "hi"); return 12; }`.
* `item`: an [item][macros.md--item]. Examples: `fn foo() { }`; `struct Bar;`.
* `meta`: a "meta item", as found in attributes. Example: `cfg(target_os = "windows")`.
* `tt`: a single token tree.

There are additional rules regarding the next token after a metavariable:

* `expr` and `stmt` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , ;`
* `ty` and `path` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , = | ; : > [ { as where`
* `pat` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , = | if in`
* Other variables may be followed by any token.

These rules provide some flexibility for Rust’s syntax to evolve without
breaking existing macros.

The macro system does not deal with parse ambiguity at all. For example, the
grammar `$($i:ident)* $e:expr` will always fail to parse, because the parser would
be forced to choose between parsing `$i` and parsing `$e`. Changing the
invocation syntax to put a distinctive token in front can solve the problem. In
this case, you can write `$(I $i:ident)* E $e:expr`.

[macros.md--item]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#items

### Scoping and macro import/export

Macros are expanded at an early stage in compilation, before name resolution.
One downside is that scoping works differently for macros, compared to other
constructs in the language.

Definition and expansion of macros both happen in a single depth-first,
lexical-order traversal of a crate’s source. So a macro defined at module scope
is visible to any subsequent code in the same module, which includes the body
of any subsequent child `mod` items.

A macro defined within the body of a single `fn`, or anywhere else not at
module scope, is visible only within that item.

If a module has the `macro_use` attribute, its macros are also visible in its
parent module after the child’s `mod` item. If the parent also has `macro_use`
then the macros will be visible in the grandparent after the parent’s `mod`
item, and so forth.

The `macro_use` attribute can also appear on `extern crate`. In this context
it controls which macros are loaded from the external crate, e.g.

```rust
#[macro_use(foo, bar)]
extern crate baz;
```

If the attribute is given simply as `#[macro_use]`, all macros are loaded. If
there is no `#[macro_use]` attribute then no macros are loaded. Only macros
defined with the `#[macro_export]` attribute may be loaded.

To load a crate’s macros without linking it into the output, use `#[no_link]`
as well.

An example:

```rust
macro_rules! m1 { () => (()) }

// visible here: m1

mod foo {
    // visible here: m1

    #[macro_export]
    macro_rules! m2 { () => (()) }

    // visible here: m1, m2
}

// visible here: m1

macro_rules! m3 { () => (()) }

// visible here: m1, m3

#[macro_use]
mod bar {
    // visible here: m1, m3

    macro_rules! m4 { () => (()) }

    // visible here: m1, m3, m4
}

// visible here: m1, m3, m4
```

When this library is loaded with `#[macro_use] extern crate`, only `m2` will
be imported.

The Rust Reference has a [listing of macro-related
attributes](http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#macro-related-attributes).

### The variable `$crate`

A further difficulty occurs when a macro is used in multiple crates. Say that
`mylib` defines

```rust
pub fn increment(x: u32) -> u32 {
    x + 1
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! inc_a {
    ($x:expr) => ( ::increment($x) )
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! inc_b {
    ($x:expr) => ( ::mylib::increment($x) )
}
```

`inc_a` only works within `mylib`, while `inc_b` only works outside the
library. Furthermore, `inc_b` will break if the user imports `mylib` under
another name.

Rust does not (yet) have a hygiene system for crate references, but it does
provide a simple workaround for this problem. Within a macro imported from a
crate named `foo`, the special macro variable `$crate` will expand to `::foo`.
By contrast, when a macro is defined and then used in the same crate, `$crate`
will expand to nothing. This means we can write

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! inc {
    ($x:expr) => ( $crate::increment($x) )
}
```

to define a single macro that works both inside and outside our library. The
function name will expand to either `::increment` or `::mylib::increment`.

To keep this system simple and correct, `#[macro_use] extern crate ...` may
only appear at the root of your crate, not inside `mod`.

### The deep end

The introductory chapter mentioned recursive macros, but it did not give the
full story. Recursive macros are useful for another reason: Each recursive
invocation gives you another opportunity to pattern-match the macro’s
arguments.

As an extreme example, it is possible, though hardly advisable, to implement
the [Bitwise Cyclic Tag](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bitwise_Cyclic_Tag) automaton
within Rust’s macro system.

```rust
macro_rules! bct {
    // cmd 0:  d ... => ...
    (0, $($ps:tt),* ; $_d:tt)
        => (bct!($($ps),*, 0 ; ));
    (0, $($ps:tt),* ; $_d:tt, $($ds:tt),*)
        => (bct!($($ps),*, 0 ; $($ds),*));

    // cmd 1p:  1 ... => 1 ... p
    (1, $p:tt, $($ps:tt),* ; 1)
        => (bct!($($ps),*, 1, $p ; 1, $p));
    (1, $p:tt, $($ps:tt),* ; 1, $($ds:tt),*)
        => (bct!($($ps),*, 1, $p ; 1, $($ds),*, $p));

    // cmd 1p:  0 ... => 0 ...
    (1, $p:tt, $($ps:tt),* ; $($ds:tt),*)
        => (bct!($($ps),*, 1, $p ; $($ds),*));

    // halt on empty data string
    ( $($ps:tt),* ; )
        => (());
}
```

Exercise: use macros to reduce duplication in the above definition of the
`bct!` macro.

### Common macros

Here are some common macros you’ll see in Rust code.

#### panic!

This macro causes the current thread to panic. You can give it a message
to panic with:

```rust
panic!("oh no!");
```

#### vec!

The `vec!` macro is used throughout the book, so you’ve probably seen it
already. It creates `Vec<T>`s with ease:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

It also lets you make vectors with repeating values. For example, a hundred
zeroes:

```rust
let v = vec![0; 100];
```

#### assert! and assert_eq!

These two macros are used in tests. `assert!` takes a boolean. `assert_eq!`
takes two values and checks them for equality. `true` passes, `false` `panic!`s.
Like this:

```rust
// A-ok!

assert!(true);
assert_eq!(5, 3 + 2);

// nope :(

assert!(5 < 3);
assert_eq!(5, 3);
```

#### try!

`try!` is used for error handling. It takes something that can return a
`Result<T, E>`, and gives `T` if it’s a `Ok<T>`, and `return`s with the
`Err(E)` if it’s that. Like this:

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn foo() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let f = try!(File::create("foo.txt"));

    Ok(())
}
```

This is cleaner than doing this:

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn foo() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let f = File::create("foo.txt");

    let f = match f {
        Ok(t) => t,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    Ok(())
}
```

#### unreachable!

This macro is used when you think some code should never execute:

```rust
if false {
    unreachable!();
}
```

Sometimes, the compiler may make you have a different branch that you know
will never, ever run. In these cases, use this macro, so that if you end
up wrong, you’ll get a `panic!` about it.

```rust
let x: Option<i32> = None;

match x {
    Some(_) => unreachable!(),
    None => println!("I know x is None!"),
}
```

#### unimplemented!

The `unimplemented!` macro can be used when you’re trying to get your functions
to typecheck, and don’t want to worry about writing out the body of the
function. One example of this situation is implementing a trait with multiple
required methods, where you want to tackle one at a time. Define the others
as `unimplemented!` until you’re ready to write them.

### Procedural macros

If Rust’s macro system can’t do what you need, you may want to write a
[compiler plugin](#sec--compiler-plugins) instead. Compared to `macro_rules!`
macros, this is significantly more work, the interfaces are much less stable,
and bugs can be much harder to track down. In exchange you get the
flexibility of running arbitrary Rust code within the compiler. Syntax
extension plugins are sometimes called ‘procedural macros’ for this reason.


## Raw Pointers {#sec--raw-pointers}


Rust has a number of different smart pointer types in its standard library, but
there are two types that are extra-special. Much of Rust’s safety comes from
compile-time checks, but raw pointers don’t have such guarantees, and are
[unsafe][raw-pointers.md--unsafe] to use.

`*const T` and `*mut T` are called ‘raw pointers’ in Rust. Sometimes, when
writing certain kinds of libraries, you’ll need to get around Rust’s safety
guarantees for some reason. In this case, you can use raw pointers to implement
your library, while exposing a safe interface for your users. For example, `*`
pointers are allowed to alias, allowing them to be used to write
shared-ownership types, and even thread-safe shared memory types (the `Rc<T>`
and `Arc<T>` types are both implemented entirely in Rust).

Here are some things to remember about raw pointers that are different than
other pointer types. They:

- are not guaranteed to point to valid memory and are not even
  guaranteed to be non-null (unlike both `Box` and `&`);
- do not have any automatic clean-up, unlike `Box`, and so require
  manual resource management;
- are plain-old-data, that is, they don't move ownership, again unlike
  `Box`, hence the Rust compiler cannot protect against bugs like
  use-after-free;
- lack any form of lifetimes, unlike `&`, and so the compiler cannot
  reason about dangling pointers; and
- have no guarantees about aliasing or mutability other than mutation
  not being allowed directly through a `*const T`.

### Basics

Creating a raw pointer is perfectly safe:

```rust
let x = 5;
let raw = &x as *const i32;

let mut y = 10;
let raw_mut = &mut y as *mut i32;
```

However, dereferencing one is not. This won’t work:

```rust
let x = 5;
let raw = &x as *const i32;

println!("raw points at {}", *raw);
```

It gives this error:

```text
error: dereference of raw pointer requires unsafe function or block [E0133]
     println!("raw points at {}", *raw);
                                  ^~~~
```

When you dereference a raw pointer, you’re taking responsibility that it’s not
pointing somewhere that would be incorrect. As such, you need `unsafe`:

```rust
let x = 5;
let raw = &x as *const i32;

let points_at = unsafe { *raw };

println!("raw points at {}", points_at);
```

For more operations on raw pointers, see [their API documentation][raw-pointers.md--rawapi].

[raw-pointers.md--unsafe]: #sec--unsafe
[raw-pointers.md--rawapi]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html

### FFI

Raw pointers are useful for FFI: Rust’s `*const T` and `*mut T` are similar to
C’s `const T*` and `T*`, respectively. For more about this use, consult the
[FFI chapter][raw-pointers.md--ffi].

[raw-pointers.md--ffi]: #sec--ffi

### References and raw pointers

At runtime, a raw pointer `*` and a reference pointing to the same piece of
data have an identical representation. In fact, an `&T` reference will
implicitly coerce to an `*const T` raw pointer in safe code and similarly for
the `mut` variants (both coercions can be performed explicitly with,
respectively, `value as *const T` and `value as *mut T`).

Going the opposite direction, from `*const` to a reference `&`, is not safe. A
`&T` is always valid, and so, at a minimum, the raw pointer `*const T` has to
point to a valid instance of type `T`. Furthermore, the resulting pointer must
satisfy the aliasing and mutability laws of references. The compiler assumes
these properties are true for any references, no matter how they are created,
and so any conversion from raw pointers is asserting that they hold. The
programmer *must* guarantee this.

The recommended method for the conversion is:

```rust
// explicit cast
let i: u32 = 1;
let p_imm: *const u32 = &i as *const u32;

// implicit coercion
let mut m: u32 = 2;
let p_mut: *mut u32 = &mut m;

unsafe {
    let ref_imm: &u32 = &*p_imm;
    let ref_mut: &mut u32 = &mut *p_mut;
}
```

The `&*x` dereferencing style is preferred to using a `transmute`. The latter
is far more powerful than necessary, and the more restricted operation is
harder to use incorrectly; for example, it requires that `x` is a pointer
(unlike `transmute`).


## `unsafe` {#sec--unsafe}


Rust’s main draw is its powerful static guarantees about behavior. But safety
checks are conservative by nature: there are some programs that are actually
safe, but the compiler is not able to verify this is true. To write these kinds
of programs, we need to tell the compiler to relax its restrictions a bit. For
this, Rust has a keyword, `unsafe`. Code using `unsafe` has less restrictions
than normal code does.

Let’s go over the syntax, and then we’ll talk semantics. `unsafe` is used in
four contexts. The first one is to mark a function as unsafe:

```rust
unsafe fn danger_will_robinson() {
    // scary stuff
}
```

All functions called from [FFI][unsafe.md--ffi] must be marked as `unsafe`, for example.
The second use of `unsafe` is an unsafe block:

[unsafe.md--ffi]: #sec--ffi

```rust
unsafe {
    // scary stuff
}
```

The third is for unsafe traits:

```rust
unsafe trait Scary { }
```

And the fourth is for `impl`ementing one of those traits:

```rust
unsafe impl Scary for i32 {}
```

It’s important to be able to explicitly delineate code that may have bugs that
cause big problems. If a Rust program segfaults, you can be sure the cause is
related to something marked `unsafe`.

### What does ‘safe’ mean?

Safe, in the context of Rust, means ‘doesn’t do anything unsafe’. It’s also
important to know that there are certain behaviors that are probably not
desirable in your code, but are expressly _not_ unsafe:

* Deadlocks
* Leaks of memory or other resources
* Exiting without calling destructors
* Integer overflow

Rust cannot prevent all kinds of software problems. Buggy code can and will be
written in Rust. These things aren’t great, but they don’t qualify as `unsafe`
specifically.

In addition, the following are all undefined behaviors in Rust, and must be
avoided, even when writing `unsafe` code:

* Data races
* Dereferencing a null/dangling raw pointer
* Reads of [undef][unsafe.md--undef] (uninitialized) memory
* Breaking the [pointer aliasing rules][unsafe.md--aliasing] with raw pointers.
* `&mut T` and `&T` follow LLVM’s scoped [noalias][unsafe.md--noalias] model, except if
  the `&T` contains an `UnsafeCell<U>`. Unsafe code must not violate these
  aliasing guarantees.
* Mutating an immutable value/reference without `UnsafeCell<U>`
* Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics:
  * Indexing outside of the bounds of an object with `std::ptr::offset`
    (`offset` intrinsic), with
    the exception of one byte past the end which is permitted.
  * Using `std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping_memory` (`memcpy32`/`memcpy64`
    intrinsics) on overlapping buffers
* Invalid values in primitive types, even in private fields/locals:
  * Null/dangling references or boxes
  * A value other than `false` (0) or `true` (1) in a `bool`
  * A discriminant in an `enum` not included in its type definition
  * A value in a `char` which is a surrogate or above `char::MAX`
  * Non-UTF-8 byte sequences in a `str`
* Unwinding into Rust from foreign code or unwinding from Rust into foreign
  code.

### Unsafe Superpowers

In both unsafe functions and unsafe blocks, Rust will let you do three things
that you normally can not do. Just three. Here they are:

1. Access or update a [static mutable variable][unsafe.md--static].
2. Dereference a raw pointer.
3. Call unsafe functions. This is the most powerful ability.

That’s it. It’s important that `unsafe` does not, for example, ‘turn off the
borrow checker’. Adding `unsafe` to some random Rust code doesn’t change its
semantics, it won’t start accepting anything. But it will let you write
things that _do_ break some of the rules.

You will also encounter the `unsafe` keyword when writing bindings to foreign
(non-Rust) interfaces. You're encouraged to write a safe, native Rust interface
around the methods provided by the library.

Let’s go over the basic three abilities listed, in order.

#### Access or update a `static mut`

Rust has a feature called ‘`static mut`’ which allows for mutable global state.
Doing so can cause a data race, and as such is inherently not safe. For more
details, see the [static][unsafe.md--static] section of the book.

[unsafe.md--static]: #static

#### Dereference a raw pointer

Raw pointers let you do arbitrary pointer arithmetic, and can cause a number of
different memory safety and security issues. In some senses, the ability to
dereference an arbitrary pointer is one of the most dangerous things you can
do. For more on raw pointers, see [their section of the book][unsafe.md--rawpointers].

[unsafe.md--rawpointers]: #sec--raw-pointers

#### Call unsafe functions

This last ability works with both aspects of `unsafe`: you can only call
functions marked `unsafe` from inside an unsafe block.

This ability is powerful and varied. Rust exposes some [compiler
intrinsics][unsafe.md--intrinsics] as unsafe functions, and some unsafe functions bypass
safety checks, trading safety for speed.

I’ll repeat again: even though you _can_ do arbitrary things in unsafe blocks
and functions doesn’t mean you should. The compiler will act as though you’re
upholding its invariants, so be careful!

[unsafe.md--intrinsics]: #sec--intrinsics


# Effective Rust {#sec--effective-rust}


So you’ve learned how to write some Rust code. But there’s a difference between
writing *any* Rust code and writing *good* Rust code.

This chapter consists of relatively independent tutorials which show you how to
take your Rust to the next level. Common patterns and standard library features
will be introduced. Read these sections in any order of your choosing.


## The Stack and the Heap {#sec--the-stack-and-the-heap}


As a systems language, Rust operates at a low level. If you’re coming from a
high-level language, there are some aspects of systems programming that you may
not be familiar with. The most important one is how memory works, with a stack
and a heap. If you’re familiar with how C-like languages use stack allocation,
this chapter will be a refresher. If you’re not, you’ll learn about this more
general concept, but with a Rust-y focus.

As with most things, when learning about them, we’ll use a simplified model to
start. This lets you get a handle on the basics, without getting bogged down
with details which are, for now, irrelevant. The examples we’ll use aren’t 100%
accurate, but are representative for the level we’re trying to learn at right
now. Once you have the basics down, learning more about how allocators are
implemented, virtual memory, and other advanced topics will reveal the leaks in
this particular abstraction.

### Memory management

These two terms are about memory management. The stack and the heap are
abstractions that help you determine when to allocate and deallocate memory.

Here’s a high-level comparison:

The stack is very fast, and is where memory is allocated in Rust by default.
But the allocation is local to a function call, and is limited in size. The
heap, on the other hand, is slower, and is explicitly allocated by your
program. But it’s effectively unlimited in size, and is globally accessible.

### The Stack

Let’s talk about this Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
}
```

This program has one variable binding, `x`. This memory needs to be allocated
from somewhere. Rust ‘stack allocates’ by default, which means that basic
values ‘go on the stack’. What does that mean?

Well, when a function gets called, some memory gets allocated for all of its
local variables and some other information. This is called a ‘stack frame’, and
for the purpose of this tutorial, we’re going to ignore the extra information
and only consider the local variables we’re allocating. So in this case, when
`main()` is run, we’ll allocate a single 32-bit integer for our stack frame.
This is automatically handled for you, as you can see; we didn’t have to write
any special Rust code or anything.

When the function exits, its stack frame gets deallocated. This happens
automatically as well.

That’s all there is for this simple program. The key thing to understand here
is that stack allocation is very, very fast. Since we know all the local
variables we have ahead of time, we can grab the memory all at once. And since
we’ll throw them all away at the same time as well, we can get rid of it very
fast too.

The downside is that we can’t keep values around if we need them for longer
than a single function. We also haven’t talked about what the word, ‘stack’,
means. To do that, we need a slightly more complicated example:

```rust
fn foo() {
    let y = 5;
    let z = 100;
}

fn main() {
    let x = 42;

    foo();
}
```

This program has three variables total: two in `foo()`, one in `main()`. Just
as before, when `main()` is called, a single integer is allocated for its stack
frame. But before we can show what happens when `foo()` is called, we need to
visualize what’s going on with memory. Your operating system presents a view of
memory to your program that’s pretty simple: a huge list of addresses, from 0
to a large number, representing how much RAM your computer has. For example, if
you have a gigabyte of RAM, your addresses go from `0` to `1,073,741,823`. That
number comes from 2^30^, the number of bytes in a gigabyte. [^the-stack-and-the-heap.md--gigabyte]

[^the-stack-and-the-heap.md--gigabyte]: ‘Gigabyte’ can mean two things: 10^9, or 2^30. The SI standard resolved this by stating that ‘gigabyte’ is 10^9, and ‘gibibyte’ is 2^30. However, very few people use this terminology, and rely on context to differentiate. We follow in that tradition here.

This memory is kind of like a giant array: addresses start at zero and go
up to the final number. So here’s a diagram of our first stack frame:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| 0       | x    | 42    |

We’ve got `x` located at address `0`, with the value `42`.

When `foo()` is called, a new stack frame is allocated:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| 2       | z    | 100   |
| 1       | y    | 5     |
| 0       | x    | 42    |

Because `0` was taken by the first frame, `1` and `2` are used for `foo()`’s
stack frame. It grows upward, the more functions we call.


There are some important things we have to take note of here. The numbers 0, 1,
and 2 are all solely for illustrative purposes, and bear no relationship to the
address values the computer will use in reality. In particular, the series of
addresses are in reality going to be separated by some number of bytes that
separate each address, and that separation may even exceed the size of the
value being stored.

After `foo()` is over, its frame is deallocated:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| 0       | x    | 42    |

And then, after `main()`, even this last value goes away. Easy!

It’s called a ‘stack’ because it works like a stack of dinner plates: the first
plate you put down is the last plate to pick back up. Stacks are sometimes
called ‘last in, first out queues’ for this reason, as the last value you put
on the stack is the first one you retrieve from it.

Let’s try a three-deep example:

```rust
fn italic() {
    let i = 6;
}

fn bold() {
    let a = 5;
    let b = 100;
    let c = 1;

    italic();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 42;

    bold();
}
```

We have some kooky function names to make the diagrams clearer.

Okay, first, we call `main()`:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| 0       | x    | 42    |

Next up, `main()` calls `bold()`:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| **3**   | **c**|**1**  |
| **2**   | **b**|**100**|
| **1**   | **a**| **5** |
| 0       | x    | 42    |

And then `bold()` calls `italic()`:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| *4*     | *i*  | *6*   |
| **3**   | **c**|**1**  |
| **2**   | **b**|**100**|
| **1**   | **a**| **5** |
| 0       | x    | 42    |
Whew! Our stack is growing tall.

After `italic()` is over, its frame is deallocated, leaving only `bold()` and
`main()`:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| **3**   | **c**|**1**  |
| **2**   | **b**|**100**|
| **1**   | **a**| **5** |
| 0       | x    | 42    |

And then `bold()` ends, leaving only `main()`:

| Address | Name | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| 0       | x    | 42    |

And then we’re done. Getting the hang of it? It’s like piling up dishes: you
add to the top, you take away from the top.

### The Heap

Now, this works pretty well, but not everything can work like this. Sometimes,
you need to pass some memory between different functions, or keep it alive for
longer than a single function’s execution. For this, we can use the heap.

In Rust, you can allocate memory on the heap with the [`Box<T>` type][the-stack-and-the-heap.md--box].
Here’s an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(5);
    let y = 42;
}
```

[the-stack-and-the-heap.md--box]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html

Here’s what happens in memory when `main()` is called:

| Address | Name | Value  |
|---------|------|--------|
| 1       | y    | 42     |
| 0       | x    | ?????? |

We allocate space for two variables on the stack. `y` is `42`, as it always has
been, but what about `x`? Well, `x` is a `Box<i32>`, and boxes allocate memory
on the heap. The actual value of the box is a structure which has a pointer to
‘the heap’. When we start executing the function, and `Box::new()` is called,
it allocates some memory for the heap, and puts `5` there. The memory now looks
like this:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 5                      |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 1                    | y    | 42                     |
| 0                    | x    | → (2^30^) - 1 |

We have (2^30^) - 1 addresses in our hypothetical computer with 1GB of RAM. And since
our stack grows from zero, the easiest place to allocate memory is from the
other end. So our first value is at the highest place in memory. And the value
of the struct at `x` has a [raw pointer][the-stack-and-the-heap.md--rawpointer] to the place we’ve
allocated on the heap, so the value of `x` is (2^30^) - 1, the memory
location we’ve asked for.

[the-stack-and-the-heap.md--rawpointer]: #sec--raw-pointers

We haven’t really talked too much about what it actually means to allocate and
deallocate memory in these contexts. Getting into very deep detail is out of
the scope of this tutorial, but what’s important to point out here is that
the heap isn’t a stack that grows from the opposite end. We’ll have an
example of this later in the book, but because the heap can be allocated and
freed in any order, it can end up with ‘holes’. Here’s a diagram of the memory
layout of a program which has been running for a while now:


| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 5                      |
| (2^30^) - 2 |      |                        |
| (2^30^) - 3 |      |                        |
| (2^30^) - 4 |      | 42                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 3                    | y    | → (2^30^) - 4 |
| 2                    | y    | 42                     |
| 1                    | y    | 42                     |
| 0                    | x    | → (2^30^) - 1 |

In this case, we’ve allocated four things on the heap, but deallocated two of
them. There’s a gap between (2^30^) - 1 and (2^30^) - 4 which isn’t
currently being used. The specific details of how and why this happens depends
on what kind of strategy you use to manage the heap. Different programs can use
different ‘memory allocators’, which are libraries that manage this for you.
Rust programs use [jemalloc][the-stack-and-the-heap.md--jemalloc] for this purpose.

[the-stack-and-the-heap.md--jemalloc]: http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/

Anyway, back to our example. Since this memory is on the heap, it can stay
alive longer than the function which allocates the box. In this case, however,
it doesn’t.[^the-stack-and-the-heap.md--moving] When the function is over, we need to free the stack frame
for `main()`. `Box<T>`, though, has a trick up its sleeve: [Drop][the-stack-and-the-heap.md--drop]. The
implementation of `Drop` for `Box` deallocates the memory that was allocated
when it was created. Great! So when `x` goes away, it first frees the memory
allocated on the heap:

| Address | Name | Value  |
|---------|------|--------|
| 1       | y    | 42     |
| 0       | x    | ?????? |

[the-stack-and-the-heap.md--drop]: #sec--drop
[^the-stack-and-the-heap.md--moving]: We can make the memory live longer by transferring ownership,
           sometimes called ‘moving out of the box’. More complex examples will
           be covered later.


And then the stack frame goes away, freeing all of our memory.

### Arguments and borrowing

We’ve got some basic examples with the stack and the heap going, but what about
function arguments and borrowing? Here’s a small Rust program:

```rust
fn foo(i: &i32) {
    let z = 42;
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    foo(y);
}
```

When we enter `main()`, memory looks like this:

| Address | Name | Value  |
|---------|------|--------|
| 1       | y    | → 0    |
| 0       | x    | 5      |

`x` is a plain old `5`, and `y` is a reference to `x`. So its value is the
memory location that `x` lives at, which in this case is `0`.

What about when we call `foo()`, passing `y` as an argument?

| Address | Name | Value  |
|---------|------|--------|
| 3       | z    | 42     |
| 2       | i    | → 0    |
| 1       | y    | → 0    |
| 0       | x    | 5      |

Stack frames aren’t only for local bindings, they’re for arguments too. So in
this case, we need to have both `i`, our argument, and `z`, our local variable
binding. `i` is a copy of the argument, `y`. Since `y`’s value is `0`, so is
`i`’s.

This is one reason why borrowing a variable doesn’t deallocate any memory: the
value of a reference is a pointer to a memory location. If we got rid of
the underlying memory, things wouldn’t work very well.

### A complex example

Okay, let’s go through this complex program step-by-step:

```rust
fn foo(x: &i32) {
    let y = 10;
    let z = &y;

    baz(z);
    bar(x, z);
}

fn bar(a: &i32, b: &i32) {
    let c = 5;
    let d = Box::new(5);
    let e = &d;

    baz(e);
}

fn baz(f: &i32) {
    let g = 100;
}

fn main() {
    let h = 3;
    let i = Box::new(20);
    let j = &h;

    foo(j);
}
```

First, we call `main()`:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

We allocate memory for `j`, `i`, and `h`. `i` is on the heap, and so has a
value pointing there.

Next, at the end of `main()`, `foo()` gets called:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

Space gets allocated for `x`, `y`, and `z`. The argument `x` has the same value
as `j`, since that’s what we passed it in. It’s a pointer to the `0` address,
since `j` points at `h`.

Next, `foo()` calls `baz()`, passing `z`:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 7                    | g    | 100                    |
| 6                    | f    | → 4                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

We’ve allocated memory for `f` and `g`. `baz()` is very short, so when it’s
over, we get rid of its stack frame:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

Next, `foo()` calls `bar()` with `x` and `z`:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| (2^30^) - 2 |      | 5                      |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 10                   | e    | → 9                    |
| 9                    | d    | → (2^30^) - 2 |
| 8                    | c    | 5                      |
| 7                    | b    | → 4                    |
| 6                    | a    | → 0                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

We end up allocating another value on the heap, and so we have to subtract one
from (2^30^) - 1. It’s easier to write that than `1,073,741,822`. In any
case, we set up the variables as usual.

At the end of `bar()`, it calls `baz()`:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| (2^30^) - 2 |      | 5                      |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 12                   | g    | 100                    |
| 11                   | f    | → (2^30^) - 2 |
| 10                   | e    | → 9                    |
| 9                    | d    | → (2^30^) - 2 |
| 8                    | c    | 5                      |
| 7                    | b    | → 4                    |
| 6                    | a    | → 0                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

With this, we’re at our deepest point! Whew! Congrats for following along this
far.

After `baz()` is over, we get rid of `f` and `g`:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| (2^30^) - 2 |      | 5                      |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 10                   | e    | → 9                    |
| 9                    | d    | → (2^30^) - 2 |
| 8                    | c    | 5                      |
| 7                    | b    | → 4                    |
| 6                    | a    | → 0                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

Next, we return from `bar()`. `d` in this case is a `Box<T>`, so it also frees
what it points to: (2^30^) - 2.

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 5                    | z    | → 4                    |
| 4                    | y    | 10                     |
| 3                    | x    | → 0                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

And after that, `foo()` returns:

| Address              | Name | Value                  |
|----------------------|------|------------------------|
| (2^30^) - 1 |      | 20                     |
| ...                  | ...  | ...                    |
| 2                    | j    | → 0                    |
| 1                    | i    | → (2^30^) - 1 |
| 0                    | h    | 3                      |

And then, finally, `main()`, which cleans the rest up. When `i` is `Drop`ped,
it will clean up the last of the heap too.

### What do other languages do?

Most languages with a garbage collector heap-allocate by default. This means
that every value is boxed. There are a number of reasons why this is done, but
they’re out of scope for this tutorial. There are some possible optimizations
that don’t make it true 100% of the time, too. Rather than relying on the stack
and `Drop` to clean up memory, the garbage collector deals with the heap
instead.

### Which to use?

So if the stack is faster and easier to manage, why do we need the heap? A big
reason is that Stack-allocation alone means you only have 'Last In First Out (LIFO)' semantics for
reclaiming storage. Heap-allocation is strictly more general, allowing storage
to be taken from and returned to the pool in arbitrary order, but at a
complexity cost.

Generally, you should prefer stack allocation, and so, Rust stack-allocates by
default. The LIFO model of the stack is simpler, at a fundamental level. This
has two big impacts: runtime efficiency and semantic impact.

#### Runtime Efficiency

Managing the memory for the stack is trivial: The machine
increments or decrements a single value, the so-called “stack pointer”.
Managing memory for the heap is non-trivial: heap-allocated memory is freed at
arbitrary points, and each block of heap-allocated memory can be of arbitrary
size, so the memory manager must generally work much harder to
identify memory for reuse.

If you’d like to dive into this topic in greater detail, [this paper][the-stack-and-the-heap.md--wilson]
is a great introduction.

[the-stack-and-the-heap.md--wilson]: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.143.4688

#### Semantic impact

Stack-allocation impacts the Rust language itself, and thus the developer’s
mental model. The LIFO semantics is what drives how the Rust language handles
automatic memory management. Even the deallocation of a uniquely-owned
heap-allocated box can be driven by the stack-based LIFO semantics, as
discussed throughout this chapter. The flexibility (i.e. expressiveness) of non
LIFO-semantics means that in general the compiler cannot automatically infer at
compile-time where memory should be freed; it has to rely on dynamic protocols,
potentially from outside the language itself, to drive deallocation (reference
counting, as used by `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>`, is one example of this).

When taken to the extreme, the increased expressive power of heap allocation
comes at the cost of either significant runtime support (e.g. in the form of a
garbage collector) or significant programmer effort (in the form of explicit
memory management calls that require verification not provided by the Rust
compiler).


## Testing {#sec--testing}

> it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.

Let's talk about how to test Rust code. What we will not be talking about is
the right way to test Rust code. There are many schools of thought regarding
the right and wrong way to write tests. All of these approaches use the same
basic tools, and so we'll show you the syntax for using them.

### The `test` attribute

At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that's annotated with the `test`
attribute. Let's make a new project with Cargo called `adder`:

```bash
$ cargo new adder
$ cd adder
```

Cargo will automatically generate a simple test when you make a new project.
Here's the contents of `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
}
```

Note the `#[test]`. This attribute indicates that this is a test function. It
currently has no body. That's good enough to pass! We can run the tests with
`cargo test`:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Cargo compiled and ran our tests. There are two sets of output here: one
for the test we wrote, and another for documentation tests. We'll talk about
those later. For now, see this line:

```text
test it_works ... ok
```

Note the `it_works`. This comes from the name of our function:

```rust
fn it_works() {
```

We also get a summary line:

```text
test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

So why does our do-nothing test pass? Any test which doesn't `panic!` passes,
and any test that does `panic!` fails. Let's make our test fail:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    assert!(false);
}
```

`assert!` is a macro provided by Rust which takes one argument: if the argument
is `true`, nothing happens. If the argument is `false`, it `panic!`s. Let's run
our tests again:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test it_works ... FAILED

failures:

---- it_works stdout ----
        thread 'it_works' panicked at 'assertion failed: false', /home/steve/tmp/adder
↳ /src/lib.rs:3



failures:
    it_works

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

thread '<main>' panicked at 'Some tests failed', /home/steve/src/rust/src/libtest/lib.
↳ rs:247
```

Rust indicates that our test failed:

```text
test it_works ... FAILED
```

And that's reflected in the summary line:

```text
test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

We also get a non-zero status code. We can use `$?` on OS X and Linux:

```bash
$ echo $?
101
```

On Windows, if you’re using `cmd`:

```bash
> echo %ERRORLEVEL%
```

And if you’re using PowerShell:

```bash
> echo $LASTEXITCODE # the code itself
> echo $? # a boolean, fail or succeed
```

This is useful if you want to integrate `cargo test` into other tooling.

We can invert our test's failure with another attribute: `should_panic`:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn it_works() {
    assert!(false);
}
```

This test will now succeed if we `panic!` and fail if we complete. Let's try it:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Rust provides another macro, `assert_eq!`, that compares two arguments for
equality:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!("Hello", "world");
}
```

Does this test pass or fail? Because of the `should_panic` attribute, it
passes:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

`should_panic` tests can be fragile, as it's hard to guarantee that the test
didn't fail for an unexpected reason. To help with this, an optional `expected`
parameter can be added to the `should_panic` attribute. The test harness will
make sure that the failure message contains the provided text. A safer version
of the example above would be:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "assertion failed")]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!("Hello", "world");
}
```

That's all there is to the basics! Let's write one 'real' test:

```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[test]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
}
```

This is a very common use of `assert_eq!`: call some function with
some known arguments and compare it to the expected output.

### The `ignore` attribute

Sometimes a few specific tests can be very time-consuming to execute. These
can be disabled by default by using the `ignore` attribute:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
}

#[test]
#[ignore]
fn expensive_test() {
    // code that takes an hour to run
}
```

Now we run our tests and see that `it_works` is run, but `expensive_test` is
not:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 2 tests
test expensive_test ... ignored
test it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

The expensive tests can be run explicitly using `cargo test -- --ignored`:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test expensive_test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

The `--ignored` argument is an argument to the test binary, and not to Cargo,
which is why the command is `cargo test -- --ignored`.

### The `tests` module

There is one way in which our existing example is not idiomatic: it's
missing the `tests` module. The idiomatic way of writing our example
looks like this:

```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::add_two;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }
}
```

There's a few changes here. The first is the introduction of a `mod tests` with
a `cfg` attribute. The module allows us to group all of our tests together, and
to also define helper functions if needed, that don't become a part of the rest
of our crate. The `cfg` attribute only compiles our test code if we're
currently trying to run the tests. This can save compile time, and also ensures
that our tests are entirely left out of a normal build.

The second change is the `use` declaration. Because we're in an inner module,
we need to bring our test function into scope. This can be annoying if you have
a large module, and so this is a common use of globs. Let's change our
`src/lib.rs` to make use of it:

```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }
}
```

Note the different `use` line. Now we run our tests:

```bash
$ cargo test
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

It works!

The current convention is to use the `tests` module to hold your "unit-style"
tests. Anything that tests one small bit of functionality makes sense to
go here. But what about "integration-style" tests instead? For that, we have
the `tests` directory.

### The `tests` directory

To write an integration test, let's make a `tests` directory, and
put a `tests/lib.rs` file inside, with this as its contents:

```rust
extern crate adder;

#[test]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
```

This looks similar to our previous tests, but slightly different. We now have
an `extern crate adder` at the top. This is because the tests in the `tests`
directory are an entirely separate crate, and so we need to import our library.
This is also why `tests` is a suitable place to write integration-style tests:
they use the library like any other consumer of it would.

Let's run them:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

     Running target/lib-c18e7d3494509e74

running 1 test
test it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Now we have three sections: our previous test is also run, as well as our new
one.

That's all there is to the `tests` directory. The `tests` module isn't needed
here, since the whole thing is focused on tests.

Let's finally check out that third section: documentation tests.

### Documentation tests

Nothing is better than documentation with examples. Nothing is worse than
examples that don't actually work, because the code has changed since the
documentation has been written. To this end, Rust supports automatically
running examples in your documentation (**note:** this only works in library
crates, not binary crates). Here's a fleshed-out `src/lib.rs` with examples:

```rust
//! The `adder` crate provides functions that add numbers to other numbers.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
//! ```

/// This function adds two to its argument.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use adder::add_two;
///
/// assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
/// ```
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }
}
```

Note the module-level documentation with `//!` and the function-level
documentation with `///`. Rust's documentation supports Markdown in comments,
and so triple graves mark code blocks. It is conventional to include the
`# Examples` section, exactly like that, with examples following.

Let's run the tests again:

```bash
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/steve/tmp/adder)
     Running target/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

     Running target/lib-c18e7d3494509e74

running 1 test
test it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests adder

running 2 tests
test add_two_0 ... ok
test _0 ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Now we have all three kinds of tests running! Note the names of the
documentation tests: the `_0` is generated for the module test, and `add_two_0`
for the function test. These will auto increment with names like `add_two_1` as
you add more examples.

We haven’t covered all of the details with writing documentation tests. For more,
please see the [Documentation chapter](#sec--documentation).

One final note: documentation tests *cannot* be run on binary crates.
To see more on file arrangement see the [Crates and
Modules](#sec--crates-and-modules) section.


## Conditional Compilation {#sec--conditional-compilation}


Rust has a special attribute, `#[cfg]`, which allows you to compile code
based on a flag passed to the compiler. It has two forms:

```rust
#[cfg(foo)]

#[cfg(bar = "baz")]
```

They also have some helpers:

```rust
#[cfg(any(unix, windows))]

#[cfg(all(unix, target_pointer_width = "32"))]

#[cfg(not(foo))]
```

These can nest arbitrarily:

```rust
#[cfg(any(not(unix), all(target_os="macos", target_arch = "powerpc")))]
```

As for how to enable or disable these switches, if you’re using Cargo,
they get set in the [`[features]` section][conditional-compilation.md--features] of your `Cargo.toml`:

[conditional-compilation.md--features]: http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#the-features-section

```toml
[features]
# no features by default
default = []

# The “secure-password” feature depends on the bcrypt package.
secure-password = ["bcrypt"]
```

When you do this, Cargo passes along a flag to `rustc`:

```text
--cfg feature="${feature_name}"
```

The sum of these `cfg` flags will determine which ones get activated, and
therefore, which code gets compiled. Let’s take this code:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "foo")]
mod foo {
}
```

If we compile it with `cargo build --features "foo"`, it will send the `--cfg
feature="foo"` flag to `rustc`, and the output will have the `mod foo` in it.
If we compile it with a regular `cargo build`, no extra flags get passed on,
and so, no `foo` module will exist.

### cfg_attr

You can also set another attribute based on a `cfg` variable with `cfg_attr`:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(a, b)]
```

Will be the same as `#[b]` if `a` is set by `cfg` attribute, and nothing otherwise.

### cfg!

The `cfg!` [syntax extension][conditional-compilation.md--compilerplugins] lets you use these kinds of flags
elsewhere in your code, too:

```rust
if cfg!(target_os = "macos") || cfg!(target_os = "ios") {
    println!("Think Different!");
}
```

[conditional-compilation.md--compilerplugins]: #sec--compiler-plugins

These will be replaced by a `true` or `false` at compile-time, depending on the
configuration settings.


## Documentation {#sec--documentation}


Documentation is an important part of any software project, and it's
first-class in Rust. Let's talk about the tooling Rust gives you to
document your project.

#### About `rustdoc`

The Rust distribution includes a tool, `rustdoc`, that generates documentation.
`rustdoc` is also used by Cargo through `cargo doc`.

Documentation can be generated in two ways: from source code, and from
standalone Markdown files.

#### Documenting source code

The primary way of documenting a Rust project is through annotating the source
code. You can use documentation comments for this purpose:

```rust
/// Constructs a new `Rc<T>`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// let five = Rc::new(5);
/// ```
pub fn new(value: T) -> Rc<T> {
    // implementation goes here
}
```

This code generates documentation that looks [like this][documentation.md--rc-new]. I've left the
implementation out, with a regular comment in its place.

The first thing to notice about this annotation is that it uses
`///` instead of `//`. The triple slash
indicates a documentation comment.

Documentation comments are written in Markdown.

Rust keeps track of these comments, and uses them when generating
documentation. This is important when documenting things like enums:

```rust
/// The `Option` type. See [the module level documentation](#sec--index) for more.
enum Option<T> {
    /// No value
    None,
    /// Some value `T`
    Some(T),
}
```

The above works, but this does not:

```rust
/// The `Option` type. See [the module level documentation](#sec--index) for more.
enum Option<T> {
    None, /// No value
    Some(T), /// Some value `T`
}
```

You'll get an error:

```text
hello.rs:4:1: 4:2 error: expected ident, found `}`
hello.rs:4 }
           ^
```

This [unfortunate error](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22547) is
correct; documentation comments apply to the thing after them, and there's
nothing after that last comment.

[documentation.md--rc-new]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/rc/struct.Rc.html#method.new

##### Writing documentation comments

Anyway, let's cover each part of this comment in detail:

```rust
/// Constructs a new `Rc<T>`.
```

The first line of a documentation comment should be a short summary of its
functionality. One sentence. Just the basics. High level.

```rust
///
/// Other details about constructing `Rc<T>`s, maybe describing complicated
/// semantics, maybe additional options, all kinds of stuff.
///
```

Our original example had just a summary line, but if we had more things to say,
we could have added more explanation in a new paragraph.

###### Special sections

Next, are special sections. These are indicated with a header, `#`. There
are four kinds of headers that are commonly used. They aren't special syntax,
just convention, for now.

```rust
/// # Panics
```

Unrecoverable misuses of a function (i.e. programming errors) in Rust are
usually indicated by panics, which kill the whole current thread at the very
least. If your function has a non-trivial contract like this, that is
detected/enforced by panics, documenting it is very important.

```rust
/// # Errors
```

If your function or method returns a `Result<T, E>`, then describing the
conditions under which it returns `Err(E)` is a nice thing to do. This is
slightly less important than `Panics`, because failure is encoded into the type
system, but it's still a good thing to do.

```rust
/// # Safety
```

If your function is `unsafe`, you should explain which invariants the caller is
responsible for upholding.

```rust
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// let five = Rc::new(5);
/// ```
```

Fourth, `Examples`. Include one or more examples of using your function or
method, and your users will love you for it. These examples go inside of
code block annotations, which we'll talk about in a moment, and can have
more than one section:

```rust
/// # Examples
///
/// Simple `&str` patterns:
///
/// ```
/// let v: Vec<&str> = "Mary had a little lamb".split(' ').collect();
/// assert_eq!(v, vec!["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"]);
/// ```
///
/// More complex patterns with a lambda:
///
/// ```
/// let v: Vec<&str> = "abc1def2ghi".split(|c: char| c.is_numeric()).collect();
/// assert_eq!(v, vec!["abc", "def", "ghi"]);
/// ```
```

Let's discuss the details of these code blocks.

###### Code block annotations

To write some Rust code in a comment, use the triple graves:

```rust
/// ```
/// println!("Hello, world");
/// ```
```

If you want something that's not Rust code, you can add an annotation:

```rust
/// ```c
/// printf("Hello, world\n");
/// ```
```

This will highlight according to whatever language you're showing off.
If you're only showing plain text, choose `text`.

It's important to choose the correct annotation here, because `rustdoc` uses it
in an interesting way: It can be used to actually test your examples in a
library crate, so that they don't get out of date. If you have some C code but
`rustdoc` thinks it's Rust because you left off the annotation, `rustdoc` will
complain when trying to generate the documentation.

#### Documentation as tests

Let's discuss our sample example documentation:

```rust
/// ```
/// println!("Hello, world");
/// ```
```

You'll notice that you don't need a `fn main()` or anything here. `rustdoc` will
automatically add a `main()` wrapper around your code, using heuristics to attempt
to put it in the right place. For example:

```rust
/// ```
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// let five = Rc::new(5);
/// ```
```

This will end up testing:

```rust
fn main() {
    use std::rc::Rc;
    let five = Rc::new(5);
}
```

Here's the full algorithm rustdoc uses to preprocess examples:

1. Any leading `#![foo]` attributes are left intact as crate attributes.
2. Some common `allow` attributes are inserted, including
   `unused_variables`, `unused_assignments`, `unused_mut`,
   `unused_attributes`, and `dead_code`. Small examples often trigger
   these lints.
3. If the example does not contain `extern crate`, then `extern crate
   <mycrate>;` is inserted (note the lack of `#[macro_use]`).
4. Finally, if the example does not contain `fn main`, the remainder of the
   text is wrapped in `fn main() { your_code }`.

This generated `fn main` can be a problem! If you have `extern crate` or a `mod`
statements in the example code that are referred to by `use` statements, they will
fail to resolve unless you include at least `fn main() {}` to inhibit step 4.
`#[macro_use] extern crate` also does not work except at the crate root, so when
testing macros an explicit `main` is always required. It doesn't have to clutter
up your docs, though -- keep reading!

Sometimes this algorithm isn't enough, though. For example, all of these code samples
with `///` we've been talking about? The raw text:

```text
/// Some documentation.
# fn foo() {}
```

looks different than the output:

```rust
/// Some documentation.
```

Yes, that's right: you can add lines that start with `# `, and they will
be hidden from the output, but will be used when compiling your code. You
can use this to your advantage. In this case, documentation comments need
to apply to some kind of function, so if I want to show you just a
documentation comment, I need to add a little function definition below
it. At the same time, it's only there to satisfy the compiler, so hiding
it makes the example more clear. You can use this technique to explain
longer examples in detail, while still preserving the testability of your
documentation.

For example, imagine that we wanted to document this code:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
println!("{}", x + y);
```

We might want the documentation to end up looking like this:

> First, we set `x` to five:
>
> ```rust
> let x = 5;
> # let y = 6;
> # println!("{}", x + y);
> ```
>
> Next, we set `y` to six:
>
> ```rust
> # let x = 5;
> let y = 6;
> # println!("{}", x + y);
> ```
>
> Finally, we print the sum of `x` and `y`:
>
> ```rust
> # let x = 5;
> # let y = 6;
> println!("{}", x + y);
> ```

To keep each code block testable, we want the whole program in each block, but
we don't want the reader to see every line every time.  Here's what we put in
our source code:

```text
    First, we set `x` to five:

    ```rust
    let x = 5;
    # let y = 6;
    # println!("{}", x + y);
    ```

    Next, we set `y` to six:

    ```rust
    # let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    # println!("{}", x + y);
    ```

    Finally, we print the sum of `x` and `y`:

    ```rust
    # let x = 5;
    # let y = 6;
    println!("{}", x + y);
    ```
```

By repeating all parts of the example, you can ensure that your example still
compiles, while only showing the parts that are relevant to that part of your
explanation.

##### Documenting macros

Here’s an example of documenting a macro:

```rust
/// Panic with a given message unless an expression evaluates to true.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate foo;
/// # fn main() {
/// panic_unless!(1 + 1 == 2, “Math is broken.”);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ```should_panic
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate foo;
/// # fn main() {
/// panic_unless!(true == false, “I’m broken.”);
/// # }
/// ```
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! panic_unless {
    ($condition:expr, $($rest:expr),+) => ({ if ! $condition { panic!($($rest),+); } }
↳ );
}
```

You’ll note three things: we need to add our own `extern crate` line, so that
we can add the `#[macro_use]` attribute. Second, we’ll need to add our own
`main()` as well (for reasons discussed above). Finally, a judicious use of
`#` to comment out those two things, so they don’t show up in the output.

Another case where the use of `#` is handy is when you want to ignore
error handling. Lets say you want the following,

```rust
/// use std::io;
/// let mut input = String::new();
/// try!(io::stdin().read_line(&mut input));
```

The problem is that `try!` returns a `Result<T, E>` and test functions
don't return anything so this will give a mismatched types error.

```rust
/// A doc test using try!
///
/// ```
/// use std::io;
/// # fn foo() -> io::Result<()> {
/// let mut input = String::new();
/// try!(io::stdin().read_line(&mut input));
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
```

You can get around this by wrapping the code in a function. This catches
and swallows the `Result<T, E>` when running tests on the docs. This
pattern appears regularly in the standard library.

##### Running documentation tests

To run the tests, either:

```bash
$ rustdoc --test path/to/my/crate/root.rs
# or
$ cargo test
```

That's right, `cargo test` tests embedded documentation too. **However,
`cargo test` will not test binary crates, only library ones.** This is
due to the way `rustdoc` works: it links against the library to be tested,
but with a binary, there’s nothing to link to.

There are a few more annotations that are useful to help `rustdoc` do the right
thing when testing your code:

```rust
/// ```ignore
/// fn foo() {
/// ```
```

The `ignore` directive tells Rust to ignore your code. This is almost never
what you want, as it's the most generic. Instead, consider annotating it
with `text` if it's not code, or using `#`s to get a working example that
only shows the part you care about.

```rust
/// ```should_panic
/// assert!(false);
/// ```
```

`should_panic` tells `rustdoc` that the code should compile correctly, but
not actually pass as a test.

```rust
/// ```no_run
/// loop {
///     println!("Hello, world");
/// }
/// ```
```

The `no_run` attribute will compile your code, but not run it. This is
important for examples such as "Here's how to start up a network service,"
which you would want to make sure compile, but might run in an infinite loop!

##### Documenting modules

Rust has another kind of doc comment, `//!`. This comment doesn't document the next item, but the enclosing item. In other words:

```rust
mod foo {
    //! This is documentation for the `foo` module.
    //!
    //! # Examples

    // ...
}
```

This is where you'll see `//!` used most often: for module documentation. If
you have a module in `foo.rs`, you'll often open its code and see this:

```rust
//! A module for using `foo`s.
//!
//! The `foo` module contains a lot of useful functionality blah blah blah
```

##### Documentation comment style

Check out [RFC 505][documentation.md--rfc505] for full conventions around the style and format of
documentation.

[documentation.md--rfc505]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0505-api-comment-conventions.md

#### Other documentation

All of this behavior works in non-Rust source files too. Because comments
are written in Markdown, they're often `.md` files.

When you write documentation in Markdown files, you don't need to prefix
the documentation with comments. For example:

```rust
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// let five = Rc::new(5);
/// ```
```

is:

~~~markdown
### Examples

```
use std::rc::Rc;

let five = Rc::new(5);
```
~~~

when it's in a Markdown file. There is one wrinkle though: Markdown files need
to have a title like this:

```markdown
% The title

This is the example documentation.
```

This `%` line needs to be the very first line of the file.

#### `doc` attributes

At a deeper level, documentation comments are syntactic sugar for documentation
attributes:

```rust
/// this

#[doc="this"]
```

are the same, as are these:

```rust
//! this

#![doc="this"]
```

You won't often see this attribute used for writing documentation, but it
can be useful when changing some options, or when writing a macro.

##### Re-exports

`rustdoc` will show the documentation for a public re-export in both places:

```ignore
extern crate foo;

pub use foo::bar;
```

This will create documentation for `bar` both inside the documentation for the
crate `foo`, as well as the documentation for your crate. It will use the same
documentation in both places.

This behavior can be suppressed with `no_inline`:

```ignore
extern crate foo;

#[doc(no_inline)]
pub use foo::bar;
```

#### Missing documentation

Sometimes you want to make sure that every single public thing in your project
is documented, especially when you are working on a library. Rust allows you to
to generate warnings or errors, when an item is missing documentation.
To generate warnings you use `warn`:

```rust
#![warn(missing_docs)]
```

And to generate errors you use `deny`:

```rust
#![deny(missing_docs)]
```

There are cases where you want to disable these warnings/errors to explicitly
leave something undocumented. This is done by using `allow`:

```rust
#[allow(missing_docs)]
struct Undocumented;
```

You might even want to hide items from the documentation completely:

```rust
#[doc(hidden)]
struct Hidden;
```

##### Controlling HTML

You can control a few aspects of the HTML that `rustdoc` generates through the
`#![doc]` version of the attribute:

```rust
#![doc(html_logo_url = "https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-128x128-blk-v2.png",
       html_favicon_url = "https://www.rust-lang.org/favicon.ico",
       html_root_url = "https://doc.rust-lang.org/")]
```

This sets a few different options, with a logo, favicon, and a root URL.

##### Configuring documentation tests

You can also configure the way that `rustdoc` tests your documentation examples
through the `#![doc(test(..))]` attribute.

```rust
#![doc(test(attr(allow(unused_variables), deny(warnings))))]
```

This allows unused variables within the examples, but will fail the test for any
other lint warning thrown.

#### Generation options

`rustdoc` also contains a few other options on the command line, for further customization:

- `--html-in-header FILE`: includes the contents of FILE at the end of the
  `<head>...</head>` section.
- `--html-before-content FILE`: includes the contents of FILE directly after
  `<body>`, before the rendered content (including the search bar).
- `--html-after-content FILE`: includes the contents of FILE after all the rendered content.

#### Security note

The Markdown in documentation comments is placed without processing into
the final webpage. Be careful with literal HTML:

```rust
/// <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```


## Iterators {#sec--iterators}


Let's talk about loops.

Remember Rust's `for` loop? Here's an example:

```rust
for x in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

Now that you know more Rust, we can talk in detail about how this works.
Ranges (the `0..10`) are 'iterators'. An iterator is something that we can
call the `.next()` method on repeatedly, and it gives us a sequence of things.

Like this:

```rust
let mut range = 0..10;

loop {
    match range.next() {
        Some(x) => {
            println!("{}", x);
        },
        None => { break }
    }
}
```

We make a mutable binding to the range, which is our iterator. We then `loop`,
with an inner `match`. This `match` is used on the result of `range.next()`,
which gives us a reference to the next value of the iterator. `next` returns an
`Option<i32>`, in this case, which will be `Some(i32)` when we have a value and
`None` once we run out. If we get `Some(i32)`, we print it out, and if we get
`None`, we `break` out of the loop.

This code sample is basically the same as our `for` loop version. The `for`
loop is a handy way to write this `loop`/`match`/`break` construct.

`for` loops aren't the only thing that uses iterators, however. Writing your
own iterator involves implementing the `Iterator` trait. While doing that is
outside of the scope of this guide, Rust provides a number of useful iterators
to accomplish various tasks. But first, a few notes about limitations of ranges.

Ranges are very primitive, and we often can use better alternatives. Consider the
following Rust anti-pattern: using ranges to emulate a C-style `for` loop. Let’s
suppose you needed to iterate over the contents of a vector. You may be tempted
to write this:

```rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

for i in 0..nums.len() {
    println!("{}", nums[i]);
}
```

This is strictly worse than using an actual iterator. You can iterate over vectors
directly, so write this:

```rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

for num in &nums {
    println!("{}", num);
}
```

There are two reasons for this. First, this more directly expresses what we
mean. We iterate through the entire vector, rather than iterating through
indexes, and then indexing the vector. Second, this version is more efficient:
the first version will have extra bounds checking because it used indexing,
`nums[i]`. But since we yield a reference to each element of the vector in turn
with the iterator, there's no bounds checking in the second example. This is
very common with iterators: we can ignore unnecessary bounds checks, but still
know that we're safe.

There's another detail here that's not 100% clear because of how `println!`
works. `num` is actually of type `&i32`. That is, it's a reference to an `i32`,
not an `i32` itself. `println!` handles the dereferencing for us, so we don't
see it. This code works fine too:

```rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

for num in &nums {
    println!("{}", *num);
}
```

Now we're explicitly dereferencing `num`. Why does `&nums` give us
references?  Firstly, because we explicitly asked it to with
`&`. Secondly, if it gave us the data itself, we would have to be its
owner, which would involve making a copy of the data and giving us the
copy. With references, we're only borrowing a reference to the data,
and so it's only passing a reference, without needing to do the move.

So, now that we've established that ranges are often not what you want, let's
talk about what you do want instead.

There are three broad classes of things that are relevant here: iterators,
*iterator adaptors*, and *consumers*. Here's some definitions:

* *iterators* give you a sequence of values.
* *iterator adaptors* operate on an iterator, producing a new iterator with a
  different output sequence.
* *consumers* operate on an iterator, producing some final set of values.

Let's talk about consumers first, since you've already seen an iterator, ranges.

#### Consumers

A *consumer* operates on an iterator, returning some kind of value or values.
The most common consumer is `collect()`. This code doesn't quite compile,
but it shows the intention:

```rust
let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect();
```

As you can see, we call `collect()` on our iterator. `collect()` takes
as many values as the iterator will give it, and returns a collection
of the results. So why won't this compile? Rust can't determine what
type of things you want to collect, and so you need to let it know.
Here's the version that does compile:

```rust
let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect::<Vec<i32>>();
```

If you remember, the `::<>` syntax allows us to give a type hint,
and so we tell it that we want a vector of integers. You don't always
need to use the whole type, though. Using a `_` will let you provide
a partial hint:

```rust
let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

This says "Collect into a `Vec<T>`, please, but infer what the `T` is for me."
`_` is sometimes called a "type placeholder" for this reason.

`collect()` is the most common consumer, but there are others too. `find()`
is one:

```rust
let greater_than_forty_two = (0..100)
                             .find(|x| *x > 42);

match greater_than_forty_two {
    Some(_) => println!("Found a match!"),
    None => println!("No match found :("),
}
```

`find` takes a closure, and works on a reference to each element of an
iterator. This closure returns `true` if the element is the element we're
looking for, and `false` otherwise. `find` returns the first element satisfying
the specified predicate. Because we might not find a matching element, `find`
returns an `Option` rather than the element itself.

Another important consumer is `fold`. Here's what it looks like:

```rust
let sum = (1..4).fold(0, |sum, x| sum + x);
```

`fold()` is a consumer that looks like this:
`fold(base, |accumulator, element| ...)`. It takes two arguments: the first
is an element called the *base*. The second is a closure that itself takes two
arguments: the first is called the *accumulator*, and the second is an
*element*. Upon each iteration, the closure is called, and the result is the
value of the accumulator on the next iteration. On the first iteration, the
base is the value of the accumulator.

Okay, that's a bit confusing. Let's examine the values of all of these things
in this iterator:

| base | accumulator | element | closure result |
|------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 0    | 0           | 1       | 1              |
| 0    | 1           | 2       | 3              |
| 0    | 3           | 3       | 6              |

We called `fold()` with these arguments:

```rust
.fold(0, |sum, x| sum + x);
```

So, `0` is our base, `sum` is our accumulator, and `x` is our element.  On the
first iteration, we set `sum` to `0`, and `x` is the first element of `nums`,
`1`. We then add `sum` and `x`, which gives us `0 + 1 = 1`. On the second
iteration, that value becomes our accumulator, `sum`, and the element is
the second element of the array, `2`. `1 + 2 = 3`, and so that becomes
the value of the accumulator for the last iteration. On that iteration,
`x` is the last element, `3`, and `3 + 3 = 6`, which is our final
result for our sum. `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and that's the result we got.

Whew. `fold` can be a bit strange the first few times you see it, but once it
clicks, you can use it all over the place. Any time you have a list of things,
and you want a single result, `fold` is appropriate.

Consumers are important due to one additional property of iterators we haven't
talked about yet: laziness. Let's talk some more about iterators, and you'll
see why consumers matter.

#### Iterators

As we've said before, an iterator is something that we can call the
`.next()` method on repeatedly, and it gives us a sequence of things.
Because you need to call the method, this means that iterators
can be *lazy* and not generate all of the values upfront. This code,
for example, does not actually generate the numbers `1-99`, instead
creating a value that merely represents the sequence:

```rust
let nums = 1..100;
```

Since we didn't do anything with the range, it didn't generate the sequence.
Let's add the consumer:

```rust
let nums = (1..100).collect::<Vec<i32>>();
```

Now, `collect()` will require that the range gives it some numbers, and so
it will do the work of generating the sequence.

Ranges are one of two basic iterators that you'll see. The other is `iter()`.
`iter()` can turn a vector into a simple iterator that gives you each element
in turn:

```rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

for num in nums.iter() {
   println!("{}", num);
}
```

These two basic iterators should serve you well. There are some more
advanced iterators, including ones that are infinite.

That's enough about iterators. Iterator adaptors are the last concept
we need to talk about with regards to iterators. Let's get to it!

#### Iterator adaptors

*Iterator adaptors* take an iterator and modify it somehow, producing
a new iterator. The simplest one is called `map`:

```rust
(1..100).map(|x| x + 1);
```

`map` is called upon another iterator, and produces a new iterator where each
element reference has the closure it's been given as an argument called on it.
So this would give us the numbers from `2-100`. Well, almost! If you
compile the example, you'll get a warning:

```text
warning: unused result which must be used: iterator adaptors are lazy and
         do nothing unless consumed, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default
(1..100).map(|x| x + 1);
 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Laziness strikes again! That closure will never execute. This example
doesn't print any numbers:

```rust
(1..100).map(|x| println!("{}", x));
```

If you are trying to execute a closure on an iterator for its side effects,
use `for` instead.

There are tons of interesting iterator adaptors. `take(n)` will return an
iterator over the next `n` elements of the original iterator. Let's try it out
with an infinite iterator:

```rust
for i in (1..).take(5) {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

This will print

```text
1
2
3
4
5
```

`filter()` is an adapter that takes a closure as an argument. This closure
returns `true` or `false`. The new iterator `filter()` produces
only the elements that the closure returns `true` for:

```rust
for i in (1..100).filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0) {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

This will print all of the even numbers between one and a hundred.
(Note that, unlike `map`, the closure passed to `filter` is passed a reference
to the element instead of the element itself. The filter predicate here uses
the `&x` pattern to extract the integer. The filter closure is passed a
reference because it returns `true` or `false` instead of the element,
so the `filter` implementation must retain ownership to put the elements
into the newly constructed iterator.)

You can chain all three things together: start with an iterator, adapt it
a few times, and then consume the result. Check it out:

```rust
(1..)
    .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0)
    .filter(|&x| x % 3 == 0)
    .take(5)
    .collect::<Vec<i32>>();
```

This will give you a vector containing `6`, `12`, `18`, `24`, and `30`.

This is just a small taste of what iterators, iterator adaptors, and consumers
can help you with. There are a number of really useful iterators, and you can
write your own as well. Iterators provide a safe, efficient way to manipulate
all kinds of lists. They're a little unusual at first, but if you play with
them, you'll get hooked. For a full list of the different iterators and
consumers, check out the [iterator module documentation](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html).


## Concurrency {#sec--concurrency}


Concurrency and parallelism are incredibly important topics in computer
science, and are also a hot topic in industry today. Computers are gaining more
and more cores, yet many programmers aren't prepared to fully utilize them.

Rust's memory safety features also apply to its concurrency story too. Even
concurrent Rust programs must be memory safe, having no data races. Rust's type
system is up to the task, and gives you powerful ways to reason about
concurrent code at compile time.

Before we talk about the concurrency features that come with Rust, it's important
to understand something: Rust is low-level enough that the vast majority of
this is provided by the standard library, not by the language. This means that
if you don't like some aspect of the way Rust handles concurrency, you can
implement an alternative way of doing things.
[mio](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) is a real-world example of this
principle in action.

#### Background: `Send` and `Sync`

Concurrency is difficult to reason about. In Rust, we have a strong, static
type system to help us reason about our code. As such, Rust gives us two traits
to help us make sense of code that can possibly be concurrent.

##### `Send`

The first trait we're going to talk about is
[`Send`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html). When a type `T` implements `Send`, it
indicates that something of this type is able to have ownership transferred
safely between threads.

This is important to enforce certain restrictions. For example, if we have a
channel connecting two threads, we would want to be able to send some data
down the channel and to the other thread. Therefore, we'd ensure that `Send` was
implemented for that type.

In the opposite way, if we were wrapping a library with [FFI][concurrency.md--ffi] that isn't
threadsafe, we wouldn't want to implement `Send`, and so the compiler will help
us enforce that it can't leave the current thread.

[concurrency.md--ffi]: #sec--ffi

##### `Sync`

The second of these traits is called [`Sync`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html).
When a type `T` implements `Sync`, it indicates that something
of this type has no possibility of introducing memory unsafety when used from
multiple threads concurrently through shared references. This implies that
types which don't have [interior mutability](#sec--mutability) are inherently
`Sync`, which includes simple primitive types (like `u8`) and aggregate types
containing them.

For sharing references across threads, Rust provides a wrapper type called
`Arc<T>`. `Arc<T>` implements `Send` and `Sync` if and only if `T` implements
both `Send` and `Sync`. For example, an object of type `Arc<RefCell<U>>` cannot
be transferred across threads because
[`RefCell`](#refcellt) does not implement
`Sync`, consequently `Arc<RefCell<U>>` would not implement `Send`.

These two traits allow you to use the type system to make strong guarantees
about the properties of your code under concurrency. Before we demonstrate
why, we need to learn how to create a concurrent Rust program in the first
place!

#### Threads

Rust's standard library provides a library for threads, which allow you to
run Rust code in parallel. Here's a basic example of using `std::thread`:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("Hello from a thread!");
    });
}
```

The `thread::spawn()` method accepts a [closure](#sec--closures), which is executed in a
new thread. It returns a handle to the thread, that can be used to
wait for the child thread to finish and extract its result:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        "Hello from a thread!"
    });

    println!("{}", handle.join().unwrap());
}
```

Many languages have the ability to execute threads, but it's wildly unsafe.
There are entire books about how to prevent errors that occur from shared
mutable state. Rust helps out with its type system here as well, by preventing
data races at compile time. Let's talk about how you actually share things
between threads.

#### Safe Shared Mutable State

Due to Rust's type system, we have a concept that sounds like a lie: "safe
shared mutable state." Many programmers agree that shared mutable state is
very, very bad.

Someone once said this:

> Shared mutable state is the root of all evil. Most languages attempt to deal
> with this problem through the 'mutable' part, but Rust deals with it by
> solving the 'shared' part.

The same [ownership system](#sec--ownership) that helps prevent using pointers
incorrectly also helps rule out data races, one of the worst kinds of
concurrency bugs.

As an example, here is a Rust program that would have a data race in many
languages. It will not compile:

```ignore
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];

    for i in 0..3 {
        thread::spawn(move || {
            data[i] += 1;
        });
    }

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
}
```

This gives us an error:

```text
8:17 error: capture of moved value: `data`
        data[i] += 1;
        ^~~~
```

Rust knows this wouldn't be safe! If we had a reference to `data` in each
thread, and the thread takes ownership of the reference, we'd have three
owners!

So, we need some type that lets us have more than one reference to a value and
that we can share between threads, that is it must implement `Sync`.

We'll use `Arc<T>`, Rust's standard atomic reference count type, which
wraps a value up with some extra runtime bookkeeping which allows us to
share the ownership of the value between multiple references at the same time.

The bookkeeping consists of a count of how many of these references exist to
the value, hence the reference count part of the name.

The Atomic part means `Arc<T>` can safely be accessed from multiple threads.
To do this the compiler guarantees that mutations of the internal count use
indivisible operations which can't have data races.


```ignore
use std::thread;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut data = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);

    for i in 0..3 {
        let data = data.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            data[i] += 1;
        });
    }

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
}
```

We now call `clone()` on our `Arc<T>`, which increases the internal count.
This handle is then moved into the new thread.

And... still gives us an error.

```text
<anon>:11:24 error: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content as mutable
<anon>:11                    data[i] += 1;
                             ^~~~
```

`Arc<T>` assumes one more property about its contents to ensure that it is safe
to share across threads: it assumes its contents are `Sync`. This is true for
our value if it's immutable, but we want to be able to mutate it, so we need
something else to persuade the borrow checker we know what we're doing.

It looks like we need some type that allows us to safely mutate a shared value,
for example a type that can ensure only one thread at a time is able to
mutate the value inside it at any one time.

For that, we can use the `Mutex<T>` type!

Here's the working version:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![1, 2, 3]));

    for i in 0..3 {
        let data = data.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut data = data.lock().unwrap();
            data[i] += 1;
        });
    }

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));
}
```

Note that the value of `i` is bound (copied) to the closure and not shared
among the threads.

Also note that [`lock`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html#method.lock) method of
[`Mutex`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html) has this signature:

```ignore
fn lock(&self) -> LockResult<MutexGuard<T>>
```

and because `Send` is not implemented for `MutexGuard<T>`, the guard cannot
cross thread boundaries, ensuring thread-locality of lock acquire and release.

Let's examine the body of the thread more closely:

```rust
thread::spawn(move || {
    let mut data = data.lock().unwrap();
    data[i] += 1;
});
```

First, we call `lock()`, which acquires the mutex's lock. Because this may fail,
it returns a `Result<T, E>`, and because this is just an example, we `unwrap()`
it to get a reference to the data. Real code would have more robust error handling
here. We're then free to mutate it, since we have the lock.

Lastly, while the threads are running, we wait on a short timer. But
this is not ideal: we may have picked a reasonable amount of time to
wait but it's more likely we'll either be waiting longer than
necessary or not long enough, depending on just how much time the
threads actually take to finish computing when the program runs.

A more precise alternative to the timer would be to use one of the
mechanisms provided by the Rust standard library for synchronizing
threads with each other. Let's talk about one of them: channels.

#### Channels

Here's a version of our code that uses channels for synchronization, rather
than waiting for a specific time:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));

    // `tx` is the "transmitter" or "sender"
    // `rx` is the "receiver"
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let (data, tx) = (data.clone(), tx.clone());

        thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut data = data.lock().unwrap();
            *data += 1;

            tx.send(()).unwrap();
        });
    }

    for _ in 0..10 {
        rx.recv().unwrap();
    }
}
```

We use the `mpsc::channel()` method to construct a new channel. We `send`
a simple `()` down the channel, and then wait for ten of them to come back.

While this channel is sending a generic signal, we can send any data that
is `Send` over the channel!

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    for i in 0..10 {
        let tx = tx.clone();

        thread::spawn(move || {
            let answer = i * i;

            tx.send(answer).unwrap();
        });
    }

    for _ in 0..10 {
        println!("{}", rx.recv().unwrap());
    }
}
```

Here we create 10 threads, asking each to calculate the square of a number (`i`
at the time of `spawn()`), and then `send()` back the answer over the channel.


#### Panics

A `panic!` will crash the currently executing thread. You can use Rust's
threads as a simple isolation mechanism:

```rust
use std::thread;

let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
    panic!("oops!");
});

let result = handle.join();

assert!(result.is_err());
```

`Thread.join()` gives us a `Result` back, which allows us to check if the thread
has panicked or not.


## Error Handling {#sec--error-handling}


Like most programming languages, Rust encourages the programmer to handle
errors in a particular way. Generally speaking, error handling is divided into
two broad categories: exceptions and return values. Rust opts for return
values.

In this section, we intend to provide a comprehensive treatment of how to deal
with errors in Rust. More than that, we will attempt to introduce error handling
one piece at a time so that you'll come away with a solid working knowledge of
how everything fits together.

When done naïvely, error handling in Rust can be verbose and annoying. This
section will explore those stumbling blocks and demonstrate how to use the
standard library to make error handling concise and ergonomic.

### Table of Contents

This section is very long, mostly because we start at the very beginning with
sum types and combinators, and try to motivate the way Rust does error handling
incrementally. As such, programmers with experience in other expressive type
systems may want to jump around.

### The Basics

You can think of error handling as using *case analysis* to determine whether
a computation was successful or not. As you will see, the key to ergonomic error
handling is reducing the amount of explicit case analysis the programmer has to
do while keeping code composable.

Keeping code composable is important, because without that requirement, we
could [`panic`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic!.html) whenever we
come across something unexpected. (`panic` causes the current task to unwind,
and in most cases, the entire program aborts.) Here's an example:

```rust
// Guess a number between 1 and 10.
// If it matches the number we had in mind, return true. Else, return false.
fn guess(n: i32) -> bool {
    if n < 1 || n > 10 {
        panic!("Invalid number: {}", n);
    }
    n == 5
}

fn main() {
    guess(11);
}
```

If you try running this code, the program will crash with a message like this:

```text
thread '<main>' panicked at 'Invalid number: 11', src/bin/panic-simple.rs:5
```

Here's another example that is slightly less contrived. A program that accepts
an integer as an argument, doubles it and prints it.

<span id="code-unwrap-double"></span>

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let mut argv = env::args();
    let arg: String = argv.nth(1).unwrap(); // error 1
    let n: i32 = arg.parse().unwrap(); // error 2
    println!("{}", 2 * n);
}
```

If you give this program zero arguments (error 1) or if the first argument
isn't an integer (error 2), the program will panic just like in the first
example.

You can think of this style of error handling as similar to a bull running
through a china shop. The bull will get to where it wants to go, but it will
trample everything in the process.

#### Unwrapping explained

In the previous example, we claimed
that the program would simply panic if it reached one of the two error
conditions, yet, the program does not include an explicit call to `panic` like
the first example. This is because the
panic is embedded in the calls to `unwrap`.

To “unwrap” something in Rust is to say, “Give me the result of the
computation, and if there was an error, panic and stop the program.”
It would be better if we showed the code for unwrapping because it is so
simple, but to do that, we will first need to explore the `Option` and `Result`
types. Both of these types have a method called `unwrap` defined on them.

##### The `Option` type

The `Option` type is [defined in the standard library][error-handling.md--5]:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

The `Option` type is a way to use Rust's type system to express the
*possibility of absence*. Encoding the possibility of absence into the type
system is an important concept because it will cause the compiler to force the
programmer to handle that absence. Let's take a look at an example that tries
to find a character in a string:

<span id="code-option-ex-string-find"></span>

```rust
// Searches `haystack` for the Unicode character `needle`. If one is found, the
// byte offset of the character is returned. Otherwise, `None` is returned.
fn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> {
    for (offset, c) in haystack.char_indices() {
        if c == needle {
            return Some(offset);
        }
    }
    None
}
```

Notice that when this function finds a matching character, it doesn't only
return the `offset`. Instead, it returns `Some(offset)`. `Some` is a variant or
a *value constructor* for the `Option` type. You can think of it as a function
with the type `fn<T>(value: T) -> Option<T>`. Correspondingly, `None` is also a
value constructor, except it has no arguments. You can think of `None` as a
function with the type `fn<T>() -> Option<T>`.

This might seem like much ado about nothing, but this is only half of the
story. The other half is *using* the `find` function we've written. Let's try
to use it to find the extension in a file name.

```rust
fn main() {
    let file_name = "foobar.rs";
    match find(file_name, '.') {
        None => println!("No file extension found."),
        Some(i) => println!("File extension: {}", &file_name[i+1..]),
    }
}
```

This code uses [pattern matching][error-handling.md--1] to do *case
analysis* on the `Option<usize>` returned by the `find` function. In fact, case
analysis is the only way to get at the value stored inside an `Option<T>`. This
means that you, as the programmer, must handle the case when an `Option<T>` is
`None` instead of `Some(t)`.

But wait, what about `unwrap`, which we used [previously](#code-unwrap-double)?
There was no case analysis there! Instead, the case analysis was put inside the
`unwrap` method for you. You could define it yourself if you want:

<span id="code-option-def-unwrap"></span>

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}

impl<T> Option<T> {
    fn unwrap(self) -> T {
        match self {
            Option::Some(val) => val,
            Option::None =>
              panic!("called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value"),
        }
    }
}
```

The `unwrap` method *abstracts away the case analysis*. This is precisely the thing
that makes `unwrap` ergonomic to use. Unfortunately, that `panic!` means that
`unwrap` is not composable: it is the bull in the china shop.

##### Composing `Option<T>` values

In an [example from before](#code-option-ex-string-find),
we saw how to use `find` to discover the extension in a file name. Of course,
not all file names have a `.` in them, so it's possible that the file name has
no extension. This *possibility of absence* is encoded into the types using
`Option<T>`. In other words, the compiler will force us to address the
possibility that an extension does not exist. In our case, we only print out a
message saying as such.

Getting the extension of a file name is a pretty common operation, so it makes
sense to put it into a function:

```rust
// Returns the extension of the given file name, where the extension is defined
// as all characters proceeding the first `.`.
// If `file_name` has no `.`, then `None` is returned.
fn extension_explicit(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    match find(file_name, '.') {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(&file_name[i+1..]),
    }
}
```

(Pro-tip: don't use this code. Use the
[`extension`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html#method.extension)
method in the standard library instead.)

The code stays simple, but the important thing to notice is that the type of
`find` forces us to consider the possibility of absence. This is a good thing
because it means the compiler won't let us accidentally forget about the case
where a file name doesn't have an extension. On the other hand, doing explicit
case analysis like we've done in `extension_explicit` every time can get a bit
tiresome.

In fact, the case analysis in `extension_explicit` follows a very common
pattern: *map* a function on to the value inside of an `Option<T>`, unless the
option is `None`, in which case, return `None`.

Rust has parametric polymorphism, so it is very easy to define a combinator
that abstracts this pattern:

<span id="code-option-map"></span>

```rust
fn map<F, T, A>(option: Option<T>, f: F) -> Option<A> where F: FnOnce(T) -> A {
    match option {
        None => None,
        Some(value) => Some(f(value)),
    }
}
```

Indeed, `map` is [defined as a method][error-handling.md--2] on `Option<T>` in the standard library.
As a method, it has a slightly different signature: methods take `self`, `&self`,
or `&mut self` as their first argument.

Armed with our new combinator, we can rewrite our `extension_explicit` method
to get rid of the case analysis:

```rust
// Returns the extension of the given file name, where the extension is defined
// as all characters proceeding the first `.`.
// If `file_name` has no `.`, then `None` is returned.
fn extension(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    find(file_name, '.').map(|i| &file_name[i+1..])
}
```

One other pattern we commonly find is assigning a default value to the case
when an `Option` value is `None`. For example, maybe your program assumes that
the extension of a file is `rs` even if none is present. As you might imagine,
the case analysis for this is not specific to file extensions - it can work
with any `Option<T>`:

```rust
fn unwrap_or<T>(option: Option<T>, default: T) -> T {
    match option {
        None => default,
        Some(value) => value,
    }
}
```

Like with `map` above, the standard library implementation is a method instead
of a free function.

The trick here is that the default value must have the same type as the value
that might be inside the `Option<T>`. Using it is dead simple in our case:

```rust
fn main() {
    assert_eq!(extension("foobar.csv").unwrap_or("rs"), "csv");
    assert_eq!(extension("foobar").unwrap_or("rs"), "rs");
}
```

(Note that `unwrap_or` is [defined as a method][error-handling.md--3] on `Option<T>` in the
standard library, so we use that here instead of the free-standing function we
defined above. Don't forget to check out the more general [`unwrap_or_else`][error-handling.md--4]
method.)

There is one more combinator that we think is worth paying special attention to:
`and_then`. It makes it easy to compose distinct computations that admit the
*possibility of absence*. For example, much of the code in this section is
about finding an extension given a file name. In order to do this, you first
need the file name which is typically extracted from a file *path*. While most
file paths have a file name, not *all* of them do. For example, `.`, `..` or
`/`.

So, we are tasked with the challenge of finding an extension given a file
*path*. Let's start with explicit case analysis:

```rust
fn file_path_ext_explicit(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    match file_name(file_path) {
        None => None,
        Some(name) => match extension(name) {
            None => None,
            Some(ext) => Some(ext),
        }
    }
}

fn file_name(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> {
  // implementation elided
  unimplemented!()
}
```

You might think that we could use the `map` combinator to reduce the case
analysis, but its type doesn't quite fit...

```rust
fn file_path_ext(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    file_name(file_path).map(|x| extension(x)) //Compilation error
}
```

The `map` function here wraps the value returned by the `extension` function
inside an `Option<_>` and since the `extension` function itself returns an
`Option<&str>` the expression `file_name(file_path).map(|x| extension(x))`
actually returns an `Option<Option<&str>>`.

But since `file_path_ext` just returns `Option<&str>` (and not
`Option<Option<&str>>`) we get a compilation error.

The result of the function taken by map as input is *always* [rewrapped with
`Some`](#code-option-map). Instead, we need something like `map`, but which
allows the caller to return a `Option<_>` directly without wrapping it in
another `Option<_>`.

Its generic implementation is even simpler than `map`:

```rust
fn and_then<F, T, A>(option: Option<T>, f: F) -> Option<A>
        where F: FnOnce(T) -> Option<A> {
    match option {
        None => None,
        Some(value) => f(value),
    }
}
```

Now we can rewrite our `file_path_ext` function without explicit case analysis:

```rust
fn file_path_ext(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    file_name(file_path).and_then(extension)
}
```

Side note: Since `and_then` essentially works like `map` but returns an
`Option<_>` instead of an `Option<Option<_>>` it is known as `flatmap` in some
other languages.

The `Option` type has many other combinators [defined in the standard
library][error-handling.md--5]. It is a good idea to skim this list and familiarize
yourself with what's available—they can often reduce case analysis
for you. Familiarizing yourself with these combinators will pay
dividends because many of them are also defined (with similar
semantics) for `Result`, which we will talk about next.

Combinators make using types like `Option` ergonomic because they reduce
explicit case analysis. They are also composable because they permit the caller
to handle the possibility of absence in their own way. Methods like `unwrap`
remove choices because they will panic if `Option<T>` is `None`.

#### The `Result` type

The `Result` type is also
[defined in the standard library][error-handling.md--6]:

<span id="code-result-def"></span>

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The `Result` type is a richer version of `Option`. Instead of expressing the
possibility of *absence* like `Option` does, `Result` expresses the possibility
of *error*. Usually, the *error* is used to explain why the execution of some
computation failed. This is a strictly more general form of `Option`. Consider
the following type alias, which is semantically equivalent to the real
`Option<T>` in every way:

```rust
type Option<T> = Result<T, ()>;
```

This fixes the second type parameter of `Result` to always be `()` (pronounced
“unit” or “empty tuple”). Exactly one value inhabits the `()` type: `()`. (Yup,
the type and value level terms have the same notation!)

The `Result` type is a way of representing one of two possible outcomes in a
computation. By convention, one outcome is meant to be expected or “`Ok`” while
the other outcome is meant to be unexpected or “`Err`”.

Just like `Option`, the `Result` type also has an
[`unwrap` method
defined][error-handling.md--7]
in the standard library. Let's define it:

```rust
impl<T, E: ::std::fmt::Debug> Result<T, E> {
    fn unwrap(self) -> T {
        match self {
            Result::Ok(val) => val,
            Result::Err(err) =>
              panic!("called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: {:?}", err),
        }
    }
}
```

This is effectively the same as our [definition for
`Option::unwrap`](#code-option-def-unwrap), except it includes the
error value in the `panic!` message. This makes debugging easier, but
it also requires us to add a [`Debug`][error-handling.md--8] constraint on the `E` type
parameter (which represents our error type). Since the vast majority
of types should satisfy the `Debug` constraint, this tends to work out
in practice. (`Debug` on a type simply means that there's a reasonable
way to print a human readable description of values with that type.)

OK, let's move on to an example.

##### Parsing integers

The Rust standard library makes converting strings to integers dead simple.
It's so easy in fact, that it is very tempting to write something like the
following:

```rust
fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> i32 {
    2 * number_str.parse::<i32>().unwrap()
}

fn main() {
    let n: i32 = double_number("10");
    assert_eq!(n, 20);
}
```

At this point, you should be skeptical of calling `unwrap`. For example, if
the string doesn't parse as a number, you'll get a panic:

```text
thread '<main>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ParseIntErro
↳ r { kind: InvalidDigit }', /home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/beta-dist-rustc-l
↳ inux/build/src/libcore/result.rs:729
```

This is rather unsightly, and if this happened inside a library you're
using, you might be understandably annoyed. Instead, we should try to
handle the error in our function and let the caller decide what to
do. This means changing the return type of `double_number`. But to
what? Well, that requires looking at the signature of the [`parse`
method][error-handling.md--9] in the standard library:

```rust
impl str {
    fn parse<F: FromStr>(&self) -> Result<F, F::Err>;
}
```

Hmm. So we at least know that we need to use a `Result`. Certainly, it's
possible that this could have returned an `Option`. After all, a string either
parses as a number or it doesn't, right? That's certainly a reasonable way to
go, but the implementation internally distinguishes *why* the string didn't
parse as an integer. (Whether it's an empty string, an invalid digit, too big
or too small.) Therefore, using a `Result` makes sense because we want to
provide more information than simply “absence.” We want to say *why* the
parsing failed. You should try to emulate this line of reasoning when faced
with a choice between `Option` and `Result`. If you can provide detailed error
information, then you probably should. (We'll see more on this later.)

OK, but how do we write our return type? The `parse` method as defined
above is generic over all the different number types defined in the
standard library. We could (and probably should) also make our
function generic, but let's favor explicitness for the moment. We only
care about `i32`, so we need to [find its implementation of
`FromStr`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html) (do a `CTRL-F` in your browser
for “FromStr”) and look at its [associated type][error-handling.md--10] `Err`. We did
this so we can find the concrete error type. In this case, it's
[`std::num::ParseIntError`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.ParseIntError.html).
Finally, we can rewrite our function:

```rust
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    match number_str.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(n) => Ok(2 * n),
        Err(err) => Err(err),
    }
}

fn main() {
    match double_number("10") {
        Ok(n) => assert_eq!(n, 20),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {:?}", err),
    }
}
```

This is a little better, but now we've written a lot more code! The case
analysis has once again bitten us.

Combinators to the rescue! Just like `Option`, `Result` has lots of combinators
defined as methods. There is a large intersection of common combinators between
`Result` and `Option`. In particular, `map` is part of that intersection:

```rust
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    number_str.parse::<i32>().map(|n| 2 * n)
}

fn main() {
    match double_number("10") {
        Ok(n) => assert_eq!(n, 20),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {:?}", err),
    }
}
```

The usual suspects are all there for `Result`, including
[`unwrap_or`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or) and
[`and_then`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.and_then).
Additionally, since `Result` has a second type parameter, there are
combinators that affect only the error type, such as
[`map_err`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.map_err) (instead of
`map`) and [`or_else`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.or_else)
(instead of `and_then`).

##### The `Result` type alias idiom

In the standard library, you may frequently see types like
`Result<i32>`. But wait, [we defined `Result`](#code-result-def) to
have two type parameters. How can we get away with only specifying
one? The key is to define a `Result` type alias that *fixes* one of
the type parameters to a particular type. Usually the fixed type is
the error type. For example, our previous example parsing integers
could be rewritten like this:

```rust
use std::num::ParseIntError;
use std::result;

type Result<T> = result::Result<T, ParseIntError>;

fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> Result<i32> {
    unimplemented!();
}
```

Why would we do this? Well, if we have a lot of functions that could return
`ParseIntError`, then it's much more convenient to define an alias that always
uses `ParseIntError` so that we don't have to write it out all the time.

The most prominent place this idiom is used in the standard library is
with [`io::Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html). Typically, one writes
`io::Result<T>`, which makes it clear that you're using the `io`
module's type alias instead of the plain definition from
`std::result`. (This idiom is also used for
[`fmt::Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/type.Result.html).)

#### A brief interlude: unwrapping isn't evil

If you've been following along, you might have noticed that I've taken a pretty
hard line against calling methods like `unwrap` that could `panic` and abort
your program. *Generally speaking*, this is good advice.

However, `unwrap` can still be used judiciously. What exactly justifies use of
`unwrap` is somewhat of a grey area and reasonable people can disagree. I'll
summarize some of my *opinions* on the matter.

* **In examples and quick 'n' dirty code.** Sometimes you're writing examples
  or a quick program, and error handling simply isn't important. Beating the
  convenience of `unwrap` can be hard in such scenarios, so it is very
  appealing.
* **When panicking indicates a bug in the program.** When the invariants of
  your code should prevent a certain case from happening (like, say, popping
  from an empty stack), then panicking can be permissible. This is because it
  exposes a bug in your program. This can be explicit, like from an `assert!`
  failing, or it could be because your index into an array was out of bounds.

This is probably not an exhaustive list. Moreover, when using an
`Option`, it is often better to use its
[`expect`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.expect)
method. `expect` does exactly the same thing as `unwrap`, except it
prints a message you give to `expect`. This makes the resulting panic
a bit nicer to deal with, since it will show your message instead of
“called unwrap on a `None` value.”

My advice boils down to this: use good judgment. There's a reason why the words
“never do X” or “Y is considered harmful” don't appear in my writing. There are
trade offs to all things, and it is up to you as the programmer to determine
what is acceptable for your use cases. My goal is only to help you evaluate
trade offs as accurately as possible.

Now that we've covered the basics of error handling in Rust, and
explained unwrapping, let's start exploring more of the standard
library.

### Working with multiple error types

Thus far, we've looked at error handling where everything was either an
`Option<T>` or a `Result<T, SomeError>`. But what happens when you have both an
`Option` and a `Result`? Or what if you have a `Result<T, Error1>` and a
`Result<T, Error2>`? Handling *composition of distinct error types* is the next
challenge in front of us, and it will be the major theme throughout the rest of
this section.

#### Composing `Option` and `Result`

So far, I've talked about combinators defined for `Option` and combinators
defined for `Result`. We can use these combinators to compose results of
different computations without doing explicit case analysis.

Of course, in real code, things aren't always as clean. Sometimes you have a
mix of `Option` and `Result` types. Must we resort to explicit case analysis,
or can we continue using combinators?

For now, let's revisit one of the first examples in this section:

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let mut argv = env::args();
    let arg: String = argv.nth(1).unwrap(); // error 1
    let n: i32 = arg.parse().unwrap(); // error 2
    println!("{}", 2 * n);
}
```

Given our new found knowledge of `Option`, `Result` and their various
combinators, we should try to rewrite this so that errors are handled properly
and the program doesn't panic if there's an error.

The tricky aspect here is that `argv.nth(1)` produces an `Option` while
`arg.parse()` produces a `Result`. These aren't directly composable. When faced
with both an `Option` and a `Result`, the solution is *usually* to convert the
`Option` to a `Result`. In our case, the absence of a command line parameter
(from `env::args()`) means the user didn't invoke the program correctly. We
could use a `String` to describe the error. Let's try:

<span id="code-error-double-string"></span>

```rust
use std::env;

fn double_arg(mut argv: env::Args) -> Result<i32, String> {
    argv.nth(1)
        .ok_or("Please give at least one argument".to_owned())
        .and_then(|arg| arg.parse::<i32>().map_err(|err| err.to_string()))
        .map(|n| 2 * n)
}

fn main() {
    match double_arg(env::args()) {
        Ok(n) => println!("{}", n),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {}", err),
    }
}
```

There are a couple new things in this example. The first is the use of the
[`Option::ok_or`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.ok_or)
combinator. This is one way to convert an `Option` into a `Result`. The
conversion requires you to specify what error to use if `Option` is `None`.
Like the other combinators we've seen, its definition is very simple:

```rust
fn ok_or<T, E>(option: Option<T>, err: E) -> Result<T, E> {
    match option {
        Some(val) => Ok(val),
        None => Err(err),
    }
}
```

The other new combinator used here is
[`Result::map_err`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.map_err).
This is like `Result::map`, except it maps a function on to the *error*
portion of a `Result` value. If the `Result` is an `Ok(...)` value, then it is
returned unmodified.

We use `map_err` here because it is necessary for the error types to remain
the same (because of our use of `and_then`). Since we chose to convert the
`Option<String>` (from `argv.nth(1)`) to a `Result<String, String>`, we must
also convert the `ParseIntError` from `arg.parse()` to a `String`.

#### The limits of combinators

Doing IO and parsing input is a very common task, and it's one that I
personally have done a lot of in Rust. Therefore, we will use (and continue to
use) IO and various parsing routines to exemplify error handling.

Let's start simple. We are tasked with opening a file, reading all of its
contents and converting its contents to a number. Then we multiply it by `2`
and print the output.

Although I've tried to convince you not to use `unwrap`, it can be useful
to first write your code using `unwrap`. It allows you to focus on your problem
instead of the error handling, and it exposes the points where proper error
handling need to occur. Let's start there so we can get a handle on the code,
and then refactor it to use better error handling.

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> i32 {
    let mut file = File::open(file_path).unwrap(); // error 1
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap(); // error 2
    let n: i32 = contents.trim().parse().unwrap(); // error 3
    2 * n
}

fn main() {
    let doubled = file_double("foobar");
    println!("{}", doubled);
}
```

(N.B. The `AsRef<Path>` is used because those are the
[same bounds used on
`std::fs::File::open`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open).
This makes it ergonomic to use any kind of string as a file path.)

There are three different errors that can occur here:

1. A problem opening the file.
2. A problem reading data from the file.
3. A problem parsing the data as a number.

The first two problems are described via the
[`std::io::Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Error.html) type. We know this
because of the return types of
[`std::fs::File::open`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open) and
[`std::io::Read::read_to_string`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#method.read_to_string).
(Note that they both use the [`Result` type alias
idiom](#the-result-type-alias-idiom) described previously. If you
click on the `Result` type, you'll [see the type
alias](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html), and consequently, the underlying
`io::Error` type.)  The third problem is described by the
[`std::num::ParseIntError`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.ParseIntError.html)
type. The `io::Error` type in particular is *pervasive* throughout the
standard library. You will see it again and again.

Let's start the process of refactoring the `file_double` function. To make this
function composable with other components of the program, it should *not* panic
if any of the above error conditions are met. Effectively, this means that the
function should *return an error* if any of its operations fail. Our problem is
that the return type of `file_double` is `i32`, which does not give us any
useful way of reporting an error. Thus, we must start by changing the return
type from `i32` to something else.

The first thing we need to decide: should we use `Option` or `Result`? We
certainly could use `Option` very easily. If any of the three errors occur, we
could simply return `None`. This will work *and it is better than panicking*,
but we can do a lot better. Instead, we should pass some detail about the error
that occurred. Since we want to express the *possibility of error*, we should
use `Result<i32, E>`. But what should `E` be? Since two *different* types of
errors can occur, we need to convert them to a common type. One such type is
`String`. Let's see how that impacts our code:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, String> {
    File::open(file_path)
         .map_err(|err| err.to_string())
         .and_then(|mut file| {
              let mut contents = String::new();
              file.read_to_string(&mut contents)
                  .map_err(|err| err.to_string())
                  .map(|_| contents)
         })
         .and_then(|contents| {
              contents.trim().parse::<i32>()
                      .map_err(|err| err.to_string())
         })
         .map(|n| 2 * n)
}

fn main() {
    match file_double("foobar") {
        Ok(n) => println!("{}", n),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {}", err),
    }
}
```

This code looks a bit hairy. It can take quite a bit of practice before code
like this becomes easy to write. The way we write it is by *following the
types*. As soon as we changed the return type of `file_double` to
`Result<i32, String>`, we had to start looking for the right combinators. In
this case, we only used three different combinators: `and_then`, `map` and
`map_err`.

`and_then` is used to chain multiple computations where each computation could
return an error. After opening the file, there are two more computations that
could fail: reading from the file and parsing the contents as a number.
Correspondingly, there are two calls to `and_then`.

`map` is used to apply a function to the `Ok(...)` value of a `Result`. For
example, the very last call to `map` multiplies the `Ok(...)` value (which is
an `i32`) by `2`. If an error had occurred before that point, this operation
would have been skipped because of how `map` is defined.

`map_err` is the trick that makes all of this work. `map_err` is like
`map`, except it applies a function to the `Err(...)` value of a `Result`. In
this case, we want to convert all of our errors to one type: `String`. Since
both `io::Error` and `num::ParseIntError` implement `ToString`, we can call the
`to_string()` method to convert them.

With all of that said, the code is still hairy. Mastering use of combinators is
important, but they have their limits. Let's try a different approach: early
returns.

#### Early returns

I'd like to take the code from the previous section and rewrite it using *early
returns*. Early returns let you exit the function early. We can't return early
in `file_double` from inside another closure, so we'll need to revert back to
explicit case analysis.

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, String> {
    let mut file = match File::open(file_path) {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(err) => return Err(err.to_string()),
    };
    let mut contents = String::new();
    if let Err(err) = file.read_to_string(&mut contents) {
        return Err(err.to_string());
    }
    let n: i32 = match contents.trim().parse() {
        Ok(n) => n,
        Err(err) => return Err(err.to_string()),
    };
    Ok(2 * n)
}

fn main() {
    match file_double("foobar") {
        Ok(n) => println!("{}", n),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {}", err),
    }
}
```

Reasonable people can disagree over whether this code is better than the code
that uses combinators, but if you aren't familiar with the combinator approach,
this code looks simpler to read to me. It uses explicit case analysis with
`match` and `if let`. If an error occurs, it simply stops executing the
function and returns the error (by converting it to a string).

Isn't this a step backwards though? Previously, we said that the key to
ergonomic error handling is reducing explicit case analysis, yet we've reverted
back to explicit case analysis here. It turns out, there are *multiple* ways to
reduce explicit case analysis. Combinators aren't the only way.

#### The `try!` macro

A cornerstone of error handling in Rust is the `try!` macro. The `try!` macro
abstracts case analysis like combinators, but unlike combinators, it also
abstracts *control flow*. Namely, it can abstract the *early return* pattern
seen above.

Here is a simplified definition of a `try!` macro:

<span id="code-try-def-simple"></span>

```rust
macro_rules! try {
    ($e:expr) => (match $e {
        Ok(val) => val,
        Err(err) => return Err(err),
    });
}
```

(The [real definition](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try!.html) is a bit more
sophisticated. We will address that later.)

Using the `try!` macro makes it very easy to simplify our last example. Since
it does the case analysis and the early return for us, we get tighter code that
is easier to read:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, String> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(|e| e.to_string()));
    let mut contents = String::new();
    try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(|e| e.to_string()));
    let n = try!(contents.trim().parse::<i32>().map_err(|e| e.to_string()));
    Ok(2 * n)
}

fn main() {
    match file_double("foobar") {
        Ok(n) => println!("{}", n),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {}", err),
    }
}
```

The `map_err` calls are still necessary given
[our definition of `try!`](#code-try-def-simple).
This is because the error types still need to be converted to `String`.
The good news is that we will soon learn how to remove those `map_err` calls!
The bad news is that we will need to learn a bit more about a couple important
traits in the standard library before we can remove the `map_err` calls.

#### Defining your own error type

Before we dive into some of the standard library error traits, I'd like to wrap
up this section by removing the use of `String` as our error type in the
previous examples.

Using `String` as we did in our previous examples is convenient because it's
easy to convert errors to strings, or even make up your own errors as strings
on the spot. However, using `String` for your errors has some downsides.

The first downside is that the error messages tend to clutter your
code. It's possible to define the error messages elsewhere, but unless
you're unusually disciplined, it is very tempting to embed the error
message into your code. Indeed, we did exactly this in a [previous
example](#code-error-double-string).

The second and more important downside is that `String`s are *lossy*. That is,
if all errors are converted to strings, then the errors we pass to the caller
become completely opaque. The only reasonable thing the caller can do with a
`String` error is show it to the user. Certainly, inspecting the string to
determine the type of error is not robust. (Admittedly, this downside is far
more important inside of a library as opposed to, say, an application.)

For example, the `io::Error` type embeds an
[`io::ErrorKind`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/enum.ErrorKind.html),
which is *structured data* that represents what went wrong during an IO
operation. This is important because you might want to react differently
depending on the error. (e.g., A `BrokenPipe` error might mean quitting your
program gracefully while a `NotFound` error might mean exiting with an error
code and showing an error to the user.) With `io::ErrorKind`, the caller can
examine the type of an error with case analysis, which is strictly superior
to trying to tease out the details of an error inside of a `String`.

Instead of using a `String` as an error type in our previous example of reading
an integer from a file, we can define our own error type that represents errors
with *structured data*. We endeavor to not drop information from underlying
errors in case the caller wants to inspect the details.

The ideal way to represent *one of many possibilities* is to define our own
sum type using `enum`. In our case, an error is either an `io::Error` or a
`num::ParseIntError`, so a natural definition arises:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::num;

// We derive `Debug` because all types should probably derive `Debug`.
// This gives us a reasonable human readable description of `CliError` values.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum CliError {
    Io(io::Error),
    Parse(num::ParseIntError),
}
```

Tweaking our code is very easy. Instead of converting errors to strings, we
simply convert them to our `CliError` type using the corresponding value
constructor:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, CliError> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(CliError::Io));
    let mut contents = String::new();
    try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(CliError::Io));
    let n: i32 = try!(contents.trim().parse().map_err(CliError::Parse));
    Ok(2 * n)
}

fn main() {
    match file_double("foobar") {
        Ok(n) => println!("{}", n),
        Err(err) => println!("Error: {:?}", err),
    }
}
```

The only change here is switching `map_err(|e| e.to_string())` (which converts
errors to strings) to `map_err(CliError::Io)` or `map_err(CliError::Parse)`.
The *caller* gets to decide the level of detail to report to the user. In
effect, using a `String` as an error type removes choices from the caller while
using a custom `enum` error type like `CliError` gives the caller all of the
conveniences as before in addition to *structured data* describing the error.

A rule of thumb is to define your own error type, but a `String` error type
will do in a pinch, particularly if you're writing an application. If you're
writing a library, defining your own error type should be strongly preferred so
that you don't remove choices from the caller unnecessarily.

### Standard library traits used for error handling

The standard library defines two integral traits for error handling:
[`std::error::Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html) and
[`std::convert::From`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html). While `Error`
is designed specifically for generically describing errors, the `From`
trait serves a more general role for converting values between two
distinct types.

#### The `Error` trait

The `Error` trait is [defined in the standard
library](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html):

```rust
use std::fmt::{Debug, Display};

trait Error: Debug + Display {
  /// A short description of the error.
  fn description(&self) -> &str;

  /// The lower level cause of this error, if any.
  fn cause(&self) -> Option<&Error> { None }
}
```

This trait is super generic because it is meant to be implemented for *all*
types that represent errors. This will prove useful for writing composable code
as we'll see later. Otherwise, the trait allows you to do at least the
following things:

* Obtain a `Debug` representation of the error.
* Obtain a user-facing `Display` representation of the error.
* Obtain a short description of the error (via the `description` method).
* Inspect the causal chain of an error, if one exists (via the `cause` method).

The first two are a result of `Error` requiring impls for both `Debug` and
`Display`. The latter two are from the two methods defined on `Error`. The
power of `Error` comes from the fact that all error types impl `Error`, which
means errors can be existentially quantified as a
[trait object](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/trait-objects.html).
This manifests as either `Box<Error>` or `&Error`. Indeed, the `cause` method
returns an `&Error`, which is itself a trait object. We'll revisit the
`Error` trait's utility as a trait object later.

For now, it suffices to show an example implementing the `Error` trait. Let's
use the error type we defined in the
[previous section](#defining-your-own-error-type):

```rust
use std::io;
use std::num;

// We derive `Debug` because all types should probably derive `Debug`.
// This gives us a reasonable human readable description of `CliError` values.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum CliError {
    Io(io::Error),
    Parse(num::ParseIntError),
}
```

This particular error type represents the possibility of two types of errors
occurring: an error dealing with I/O or an error converting a string to a
number. The error could represent as many error types as you want by adding new
variants to the `enum` definition.

Implementing `Error` is pretty straight-forward. It's mostly going to be a lot
explicit case analysis.

```rust
use std::error;
use std::fmt;

impl fmt::Display for CliError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            // Both underlying errors already impl `Display`, so we defer to
            // their implementations.
            CliError::Io(ref err) => write!(f, "IO error: {}", err),
            CliError::Parse(ref err) => write!(f, "Parse error: {}", err),
        }
    }
}

impl error::Error for CliError {
    fn description(&self) -> &str {
        // Both underlying errors already impl `Error`, so we defer to their
        // implementations.
        match *self {
            CliError::Io(ref err) => err.description(),
            CliError::Parse(ref err) => err.description(),
        }
    }

    fn cause(&self) -> Option<&error::Error> {
        match *self {
            // N.B. Both of these implicitly cast `err` from their concrete
            // types (either `&io::Error` or `&num::ParseIntError`)
            // to a trait object `&Error`. This works because both error types
            // implement `Error`.
            CliError::Io(ref err) => Some(err),
            CliError::Parse(ref err) => Some(err),
        }
    }
}
```

We note that this is a very typical implementation of `Error`: match on your
different error types and satisfy the contracts defined for `description` and
`cause`.

#### The `From` trait

The `std::convert::From` trait is
[defined in the standard
library](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html):

<span id="code-from-def"></span>

```rust
trait From<T> {
    fn from(T) -> Self;
}
```

Deliciously simple, yes? `From` is very useful because it gives us a generic
way to talk about conversion *from* a particular type `T` to some other type
(in this case, “some other type” is the subject of the impl, or `Self`).
The crux of `From` is the
[set of implementations provided by the standard
library](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html).

Here are a few simple examples demonstrating how `From` works:

```rust
let string: String = From::from("foo");
let bytes: Vec<u8> = From::from("foo");
let cow: ::std::borrow::Cow<str> = From::from("foo");
```

OK, so `From` is useful for converting between strings. But what about errors?
It turns out, there is one critical impl:

```rust
impl<'a, E: Error + 'a> From<E> for Box<Error + 'a>
```

This impl says that for *any* type that impls `Error`, we can convert it to a
trait object `Box<Error>`. This may not seem terribly surprising, but it is
useful in a generic context.

Remember the two errors we were dealing with previously? Specifically,
`io::Error` and `num::ParseIntError`. Since both impl `Error`, they work with
`From`:

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs;
use std::io;
use std::num;

// We have to jump through some hoops to actually get error values.
let io_err: io::Error = io::Error::last_os_error();
let parse_err: num::ParseIntError = "not a number".parse::<i32>().unwrap_err();

// OK, here are the conversions.
let err1: Box<Error> = From::from(io_err);
let err2: Box<Error> = From::from(parse_err);
```

There is a really important pattern to recognize here. Both `err1` and `err2`
have the *same type*. This is because they are existentially quantified types,
or trait objects. In particular, their underlying type is *erased* from the
compiler's knowledge, so it truly sees `err1` and `err2` as exactly the same.
Additionally, we constructed `err1` and `err2` using precisely the same
function call: `From::from`. This is because `From::from` is overloaded on both
its argument and its return type.

This pattern is important because it solves a problem we had earlier: it gives
us a way to reliably convert errors to the same type using the same function.

Time to revisit an old friend; the `try!` macro.

#### The real `try!` macro

Previously, we presented this definition of `try!`:

```rust
macro_rules! try {
    ($e:expr) => (match $e {
        Ok(val) => val,
        Err(err) => return Err(err),
    });
}
```

This is not its real definition. Its real definition is
[in the standard library](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try!.html):

<span id="code-try-def"></span>

```rust
macro_rules! try {
    ($e:expr) => (match $e {
        Ok(val) => val,
        Err(err) => return Err(::std::convert::From::from(err)),
    });
}
```

There's one tiny but powerful change: the error value is passed through
`From::from`. This makes the `try!` macro a lot more powerful because it gives
you automatic type conversion for free.

Armed with our more powerful `try!` macro, let's take a look at code we wrote
previously to read a file and convert its contents to an integer:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, String> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(|e| e.to_string()));
    let mut contents = String::new();
    try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(|e| e.to_string()));
    let n = try!(contents.trim().parse::<i32>().map_err(|e| e.to_string()));
    Ok(2 * n)
}
```

Earlier, we promised that we could get rid of the `map_err` calls. Indeed, all
we have to do is pick a type that `From` works with. As we saw in the previous
section, `From` has an impl that lets it convert any error type into a
`Box<Error>`:

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, Box<Error>> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path));
    let mut contents = String::new();
    try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents));
    let n = try!(contents.trim().parse::<i32>());
    Ok(2 * n)
}
```

We are getting very close to ideal error handling. Our code has very little
overhead as a result from error handling because the `try!` macro encapsulates
three things simultaneously:

1. Case analysis.
2. Control flow.
3. Error type conversion.

When all three things are combined, we get code that is unencumbered by
combinators, calls to `unwrap` or case analysis.

There's one little nit left: the `Box<Error>` type is *opaque*. If we
return a `Box<Error>` to the caller, the caller can't (easily) inspect
underlying error type. The situation is certainly better than `String`
because the caller can call methods like
[`description`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#tymethod.description)
and [`cause`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.cause), but the
limitation remains: `Box<Error>` is opaque. (N.B. This isn't entirely
true because Rust does have runtime reflection, which is useful in
some scenarios that are [beyond the scope of this
section](https://crates.io/crates/error).)

It's time to revisit our custom `CliError` type and tie everything together.

#### Composing custom error types

In the last section, we looked at the real `try!` macro and how it does
automatic type conversion for us by calling `From::from` on the error value.
In particular, we converted errors to `Box<Error>`, which works, but the type
is opaque to callers.

To fix this, we use the same remedy that we're already familiar with: a custom
error type. Once again, here is the code that reads the contents of a file and
converts it to an integer:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};
use std::num;
use std::path::Path;

// We derive `Debug` because all types should probably derive `Debug`.
// This gives us a reasonable human readable description of `CliError` values.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum CliError {
    Io(io::Error),
    Parse(num::ParseIntError),
}

fn file_double_verbose<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, CliError> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(CliError::Io));
    let mut contents = String::new();
    try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(CliError::Io));
    let n: i32 = try!(contents.trim().parse().map_err(CliError::Parse));
    Ok(2 * n)
}
```

Notice that we still have the calls to `map_err`. Why? Well, recall the
definitions of [`try!`](#code-try-def) and [`From`](#code-from-def). The
problem is that there is no `From` impl that allows us to convert from error
types like `io::Error` and `num::ParseIntError` to our own custom `CliError`.
Of course, it is easy to fix this! Since we defined `CliError`, we can impl
`From` with it:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::num;

impl From<io::Error> for CliError {
    fn from(err: io::Error) -> CliError {
        CliError::Io(err)
    }
}

impl From<num::ParseIntError> for CliError {
    fn from(err: num::ParseIntError) -> CliError {
        CliError::Parse(err)
    }
}
```

All these impls are doing is teaching `From` how to create a `CliError` from
other error types. In our case, construction is as simple as invoking the
corresponding value constructor. Indeed, it is *typically* this easy.

We can finally rewrite `file_double`:

```rust

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;

fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, CliError> {
    let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path));
    let mut contents = String::new();
    try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents));
    let n: i32 = try!(contents.trim().parse());
    Ok(2 * n)
}
```

The only thing we did here was remove the calls to `map_err`. They are no
longer needed because the `try!` macro invokes `From::from` on the error value.
This works because we've provided `From` impls for all the error types that
could appear.

If we modified our `file_double` function to perform some other operation, say,
convert a string to a float, then we'd need to add a new variant to our error
type:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::num;

enum CliError {
    Io(io::Error),
    ParseInt(num::ParseIntError),
    ParseFloat(num::ParseFloatError),
}
```

And add a new `From` impl:

```rust

use std::num;

impl From<num::ParseFloatError> for CliError {
    fn from(err: num::ParseFloatError) -> CliError {
        CliError::ParseFloat(err)
    }
}
```

And that's it!

#### Advice for library writers

If your library needs to report custom errors, then you should
probably define your own error type. It's up to you whether or not to
expose its representation (like
[`ErrorKind`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/enum.ErrorKind.html)) or keep it hidden (like
[`ParseIntError`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.ParseIntError.html)). Regardless
of how you do it, it's usually good practice to at least provide some
information about the error beyond its `String`
representation. But certainly, this will vary depending on use cases.

At a minimum, you should probably implement the
[`Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html)
trait. This will give users of your library some minimum flexibility for
[composing errors](#the-real-try-macro). Implementing the `Error` trait also
means that users are guaranteed the ability to obtain a string representation
of an error (because it requires impls for both `fmt::Debug` and
`fmt::Display`).

Beyond that, it can also be useful to provide implementations of `From` on your
error types. This allows you (the library author) and your users to
[compose more detailed errors](#composing-custom-error-types). For example,
[`csv::Error`](http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/enum.Error.html)
provides `From` impls for both `io::Error` and `byteorder::Error`.

Finally, depending on your tastes, you may also want to define a
[`Result` type alias](#the-result-type-alias-idiom), particularly if your
library defines a single error type. This is used in the standard library
for [`io::Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html)
and [`fmt::Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/type.Result.html).

### Case study: A program to read population data

This section was long, and depending on your background, it might be
rather dense. While there is plenty of example code to go along with
the prose, most of it was specifically designed to be pedagogical. So,
we're going to do something new: a case study.

For this, we're going to build up a command line program that lets you
query world population data. The objective is simple: you give it a location
and it will tell you the population. Despite the simplicity, there is a lot
that can go wrong!

The data we'll be using comes from the [Data Science
Toolkit][error-handling.md--11]. I've prepared some data from it for this exercise. You
can either grab the [world population data][error-handling.md--12] (41MB gzip compressed,
145MB uncompressed) or only the [US population data][error-handling.md--13] (2.2MB gzip
compressed, 7.2MB uncompressed).

Up until now, we've kept the code limited to Rust's standard library. For a real
task like this though, we'll want to at least use something to parse CSV data,
parse the program arguments and decode that stuff into Rust types automatically. For that, we'll use the
[`csv`](https://crates.io/crates/csv),
and [`rustc-serialize`](https://crates.io/crates/rustc-serialize) crates.

#### Initial setup

We're not going to spend a lot of time on setting up a project with
Cargo because it is already covered well in [the Cargo
section](#hello-cargo) and [Cargo's documentation][error-handling.md--14].

To get started from scratch, run `cargo new --bin city-pop` and make sure your
`Cargo.toml` looks something like this:

```text
[package]
name = "city-pop"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Andrew Gallant <jamslam@gmail.com>"]

[[bin]]
name = "city-pop"

[dependencies]
csv = "0.*"
rustc-serialize = "0.*"
getopts = "0.*"
```

You should already be able to run:

```text
cargo build --release
./target/release/city-pop
# Outputs: Hello, world!
```

#### Argument parsing

Let's get argument parsing out of the way. We won't go into too much
detail on Getopts, but there is [some good documentation][error-handling.md--15]
describing it. The short story is that Getopts generates an argument
parser and a help message from a vector of options (The fact that it
is a vector is hidden behind a struct and a set of methods). Once the
parsing is done, we can decode the program arguments into a Rust
struct. From there, we can get information about the flags, for
instance, whether they were passed in, and what arguments they
had. Here's our program with the appropriate `extern crate`
statements, and the basic argument setup for Getopts:

```rust
extern crate getopts;
extern crate rustc_serialize;

use getopts::Options;
use std::env;

fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) {
    println!("{}", opts.usage(&format!("Usage: {} [options] <data-path> <city>", progr
↳ am)));
}

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let program = &args[0];

    let mut opts = Options::new();
    opts.optflag("h", "help", "Show this usage message.");

    let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) {
        Ok(m)  => { m }
        Err(e) => { panic!(e.to_string()) }
    };
    if matches.opt_present("h") {
        print_usage(&program, opts);
        return;
    }
    let data_path = &args[1];
    let city = &args[2];

    // Do stuff with information
}
```

First, we get a vector of the arguments passed into our program. We
then store the first one, knowing that it is our program's name. Once
that's done, we set up our argument flags, in this case a simplistic
help message flag. Once we have the argument flags set up, we use
`Options.parse` to parse the argument vector (starting from index one,
because index 0 is the program name). If this was successful, we
assign matches to the parsed object, if not, we panic. Once past that,
we test if the user passed in the help flag, and if so print the usage
message. The option help messages are constructed by Getopts, so all
we have to do to print the usage message is tell it what we want it to
print for the program name and template. If the user has not passed in
the help flag, we assign the proper variables to their corresponding
arguments.

#### Writing the logic

We all write code differently, but error handling is usually the last thing we
want to think about. This isn't great for the overall design of a program, but
it can be useful for rapid prototyping. Because Rust forces us to be explicit
about error handling (by making us call `unwrap`), it is easy to see which
parts of our program can cause errors.

In this case study, the logic is really simple. All we need to do is parse the
CSV data given to us and print out a field in matching rows. Let's do it. (Make
sure to add `extern crate csv;` to the top of your file.)

```rust
use std::fs::File;

// This struct represents the data in each row of the CSV file.
// Type based decoding absolves us of a lot of the nitty gritty error
// handling, like parsing strings as integers or floats.
#[derive(Debug, RustcDecodable)]
struct Row {
    country: String,
    city: String,
    accent_city: String,
    region: String,

    // Not every row has data for the population, latitude or longitude!
    // So we express them as `Option` types, which admits the possibility of
    // absence. The CSV parser will fill in the correct value for us.
    population: Option<u64>,
    latitude: Option<f64>,
    longitude: Option<f64>,
}

fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) {
    println!("{}", opts.usage(&format!("Usage: {} [options] <data-path> <city>", progr
↳ am)));
}

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let program = &args[0];

    let mut opts = Options::new();
    opts.optflag("h", "help", "Show this usage message.");

    let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) {
        Ok(m)  => { m }
        Err(e) => { panic!(e.to_string()) }
    };

    if matches.opt_present("h") {
        print_usage(&program, opts);
        return;
    }

    let data_path = &args[1];
    let city: &str = &args[2];

    let file = File::open(data_path).unwrap();
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file);

    for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() {
        let row = row.unwrap();

        if row.city == city {
            println!("{}, {}: {:?}",
                row.city, row.country,
                row.population.expect("population count"));
        }
    }
}
```

Let's outline the errors. We can start with the obvious: the three places that
`unwrap` is called:

1. [`File::open`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open)
   can return an
   [`io::Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Error.html).
2. [`csv::Reader::decode`](http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/struct.Reader.html#method.decode)
   decodes one record at a time, and
   [decoding a
   record](http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/struct.DecodedRecords.html)
   (look at the `Item` associated type on the `Iterator` impl)
   can produce a
   [`csv::Error`](http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/enum.Error.html).
3. If `row.population` is `None`, then calling `expect` will panic.

Are there any others? What if we can't find a matching city? Tools like `grep`
will return an error code, so we probably should too. So we have logic errors
specific to our problem, IO errors and CSV parsing errors. We're going to
explore two different ways to approach handling these errors.

I'd like to start with `Box<Error>`. Later, we'll see how defining our own
error type can be useful.

#### Error handling with `Box<Error>`

`Box<Error>` is nice because it *just works*. You don't need to define your own
error types and you don't need any `From` implementations. The downside is that
since `Box<Error>` is a trait object, it *erases the type*, which means the
compiler can no longer reason about its underlying type.

[Previously](#the-limits-of-combinators) we started refactoring our code by
changing the type of our function from `T` to `Result<T, OurErrorType>`. In
this case, `OurErrorType` is only `Box<Error>`. But what's `T`? And can we add
a return type to `main`?

The answer to the second question is no, we can't. That means we'll need to
write a new function. But what is `T`? The simplest thing we can do is to
return a list of matching `Row` values as a `Vec<Row>`. (Better code would
return an iterator, but that is left as an exercise to the reader.)

Let's refactor our code into its own function, but keep the calls to `unwrap`.
Note that we opt to handle the possibility of a missing population count by
simply ignoring that row.

```rust
use std::path::Path;

struct Row {
    // unchanged
}

struct PopulationCount {
    city: String,
    country: String,
    // This is no longer an `Option` because values of this type are only
    // constructed if they have a population count.
    count: u64,
}

fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) {
    println!("{}", opts.usage(&format!("Usage: {} [options] <data-path> <city>", progr
↳ am)));
}

fn search<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P, city: &str) -> Vec<PopulationCount> {
    let mut found = vec![];
    let file = File::open(file_path).unwrap();
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file);
    for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() {
        let row = row.unwrap();
        match row.population {
            None => { } // skip it
            Some(count) => if row.city == city {
                found.push(PopulationCount {
                    city: row.city,
                    country: row.country,
                    count: count,
                });
            },
        }
    }
    found
}

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let program = &args[0];

    let mut opts = Options::new();
    opts.optflag("h", "help", "Show this usage message.");

    let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) {
        Ok(m)  => { m }
        Err(e) => { panic!(e.to_string()) }
    };
    if matches.opt_present("h") {
        print_usage(&program, opts);
        return;
    }

    let data_path = &args[1];
    let city = &args[2];
    for pop in search(data_path, city) {
        println!("{}, {}: {:?}", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count);
    }
}

```

While we got rid of one use of `expect` (which is a nicer variant of `unwrap`),
we still should handle the absence of any search results.

To convert this to proper error handling, we need to do the following:

1. Change the return type of `search` to be `Result<Vec<PopulationCount>,
   Box<Error>>`.
2. Use the [`try!` macro](#code-try-def) so that errors are returned to the
   caller instead of panicking the program.
3. Handle the error in `main`.

Let's try it:

```rust
use std::error::Error;

// The rest of the code before this is unchanged

fn search<P: AsRef<Path>>
         (file_path: P, city: &str)
         -> Result<Vec<PopulationCount>, Box<Error+Send+Sync>> {
    let mut found = vec![];
    let file = try!(File::open(file_path));
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file);
    for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() {
        let row = try!(row);
        match row.population {
            None => { } // skip it
            Some(count) => if row.city == city {
                found.push(PopulationCount {
                    city: row.city,
                    country: row.country,
                    count: count,
                });
            },
        }
    }
    if found.is_empty() {
        Err(From::from("No matching cities with a population were found."))
    } else {
        Ok(found)
    }
}
```

Instead of `x.unwrap()`, we now have `try!(x)`. Since our function returns a
`Result<T, E>`, the `try!` macro will return early from the function if an
error occurs.

There is one big gotcha in this code: we used `Box<Error + Send + Sync>`
instead of `Box<Error>`. We did this so we could convert a plain string to an
error type. We need these extra bounds so that we can use the
[corresponding `From`
impls](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html):

```rust
// We are making use of this impl in the code above, since we call `From::from`
// on a `&'static str`.
impl<'a, 'b> From<&'b str> for Box<Error + Send + Sync + 'a>

// But this is also useful when you need to allocate a new string for an
// error message, usually with `format!`.
impl From<String> for Box<Error + Send + Sync>
```

Since `search` now returns a `Result<T, E>`, `main` should use case analysis
when calling `search`:

```rust
...
match search(&data_file, &city) {
    Ok(pops) => {
        for pop in pops {
            println!("{}, {}: {:?}", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count);
        }
    }
    Err(err) => println!("{}", err)
}
...
```

Now that we've seen how to do proper error handling with `Box<Error>`, let's
try a different approach with our own custom error type. But first, let's take
a quick break from error handling and add support for reading from `stdin`.

#### Reading from stdin

In our program, we accept a single file for input and do one pass over the
data. This means we probably should be able to accept input on stdin. But maybe
we like the current format too—so let's have both!

Adding support for stdin is actually quite easy. There are only three things we
have to do:

1. Tweak the program arguments so that a single parameter—the
   city—can be accepted while the population data is read from stdin.
2. Modify the program so that an option `-f` can take the file, if it
    is not passed into stdin.
3. Modify the `search` function to take an *optional* file path. When `None`,
   it should know to read from stdin.

First, here's the new usage:

```rust
fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) {
    println!("{}", opts.usage(&format!("Usage: {} [options] <city>", program)));
}
```
The next part is going to be only a little harder:

```rust
...
let mut opts = Options::new();
opts.optopt("f", "file", "Choose an input file, instead of using STDIN.", "NAME");
opts.optflag("h", "help", "Show this usage message.");
...
let file = matches.opt_str("f");
let data_file = &file.as_ref().map(Path::new);

let city = if !matches.free.is_empty() {
    &matches.free[0]
} else {
    print_usage(&program, opts);
    return;
};

match search(data_file, city) {
    Ok(pops) => {
        for pop in pops {
            println!("{}, {}: {:?}", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count);
        }
    }
    Err(err) => println!("{}", err)
}
...
```

In this piece of code, we take `file` (which has the type
`Option<String>`), and convert it to a type that `search` can use, in
this case, `&Option<AsRef<Path>>`. To do this, we take a reference of
file, and map `Path::new` onto it. In this case, `as_ref()` converts
the `Option<String>` into an `Option<&str>`, and from there, we can
execute `Path::new` to the content of the optional, and return the
optional of the new value. Once we have that, it is a simple matter of
getting the `city` argument and executing `search`.

Modifying `search` is slightly trickier. The `csv` crate can build a
parser out of
[any type that implements `io::Read`](http://burntsushi.net/rustdoc/csv/struct.Reader.html#method.from_reader).
But how can we use the same code over both types? There's actually a
couple ways we could go about this. One way is to write `search` such
that it is generic on some type parameter `R` that satisfies
`io::Read`. Another way is to use trait objects:

```rust
use std::io;

// The rest of the code before this is unchanged

fn search<P: AsRef<Path>>
         (file_path: &Option<P>, city: &str)
         -> Result<Vec<PopulationCount>, Box<Error+Send+Sync>> {
    let mut found = vec![];
    let input: Box<io::Read> = match *file_path {
        None => Box::new(io::stdin()),
        Some(ref file_path) => Box::new(try!(File::open(file_path))),
    };
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(input);
    // The rest remains unchanged!
}
```

#### Error handling with a custom type

Previously, we learned how to
[compose errors using a custom error type](#composing-custom-error-types).
We did this by defining our error type as an `enum` and implementing `Error`
and `From`.

Since we have three distinct errors (IO, CSV parsing and not found), let's
define an `enum` with three variants:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum CliError {
    Io(io::Error),
    Csv(csv::Error),
    NotFound,
}
```

And now for impls on `Display` and `Error`:

```rust
impl fmt::Display for CliError {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            CliError::Io(ref err) => err.fmt(f),
            CliError::Csv(ref err) => err.fmt(f),
            CliError::NotFound => write!(f, "No matching cities with a \
                                             population were found."),
        }
    }
}

impl Error for CliError {
    fn description(&self) -> &str {
        match *self {
            CliError::Io(ref err) => err.description(),
            CliError::Csv(ref err) => err.description(),
            CliError::NotFound => "not found",
        }
    }
}
```

Before we can use our `CliError` type in our `search` function, we need to
provide a couple `From` impls. How do we know which impls to provide? Well,
we'll need to convert from both `io::Error` and `csv::Error` to `CliError`.
Those are the only external errors, so we'll only need two `From` impls for
now:

```rust
impl From<io::Error> for CliError {
    fn from(err: io::Error) -> CliError {
        CliError::Io(err)
    }
}

impl From<csv::Error> for CliError {
    fn from(err: csv::Error) -> CliError {
        CliError::Csv(err)
    }
}
```

The `From` impls are important because of how
[`try!` is defined](#code-try-def). In particular, if an error occurs,
`From::from` is called on the error, which in this case, will convert it to our
own error type `CliError`.

With the `From` impls done, we only need to make two small tweaks to our
`search` function: the return type and the “not found” error. Here it is in
full:

```rust
fn search<P: AsRef<Path>>
         (file_path: &Option<P>, city: &str)
         -> Result<Vec<PopulationCount>, CliError> {
    let mut found = vec![];
    let input: Box<io::Read> = match *file_path {
        None => Box::new(io::stdin()),
        Some(ref file_path) => Box::new(try!(File::open(file_path))),
    };
    let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(input);
    for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() {
        let row = try!(row);
        match row.population {
            None => { } // skip it
            Some(count) => if row.city == city {
                found.push(PopulationCount {
                    city: row.city,
                    country: row.country,
                    count: count,
                });
            },
        }
    }
    if found.is_empty() {
        Err(CliError::NotFound)
    } else {
        Ok(found)
    }
}
```

No other changes are necessary.

#### Adding functionality

Writing generic code is great, because generalizing stuff is cool, and
it can then be useful later. But sometimes, the juice isn't worth the
squeeze. Look at what we just did in the previous step:

1. Defined a new error type.
2. Added impls for `Error`, `Display` and two for `From`.

The big downside here is that our program didn't improve a whole lot.
There is quite a bit of overhead to representing errors with `enum`s,
especially in short programs like this.

*One* useful aspect of using a custom error type like we've done here is that
the `main` function can now choose to handle errors differently. Previously,
with `Box<Error>`, it didn't have much of a choice: just print the message.
We're still doing that here, but what if we wanted to, say, add a `--quiet`
flag? The `--quiet` flag should silence any verbose output.

Right now, if the program doesn't find a match, it will output a message saying
so. This can be a little clumsy, especially if you intend for the program to
be used in shell scripts.

So let's start by adding the flags. Like before, we need to tweak the usage
string and add a flag to the Option variable. Once we've done that, Getopts does the rest:

```rust
...
let mut opts = Options::new();
opts.optopt("f", "file", "Choose an input file, instead of using STDIN.", "NAME");
opts.optflag("h", "help", "Show this usage message.");
opts.optflag("q", "quiet", "Silences errors and warnings.");
...
```

Now we only need to implement our “quiet” functionality. This requires us to
tweak the case analysis in `main`:

```rust
match search(&args.arg_data_path, &args.arg_city) {
    Err(CliError::NotFound) if args.flag_quiet => process::exit(1),
    Err(err) => panic!("{}", err),
    Ok(pops) => for pop in pops {
        println!("{}, {}: {:?}", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count);
    }
}
```

Certainly, we don't want to be quiet if there was an IO error or if the data
failed to parse. Therefore, we use case analysis to check if the error type is
`NotFound` *and* if `--quiet` has been enabled. If the search failed, we still
quit with an exit code (following `grep`'s convention).

If we had stuck with `Box<Error>`, then it would be pretty tricky to implement
the `--quiet` functionality.

This pretty much sums up our case study. From here, you should be ready to go
out into the world and write your own programs and libraries with proper error
handling.

### The Short Story

Since this section is long, it is useful to have a quick summary for error
handling in Rust. These are some good “rules of thumb." They are emphatically
*not* commandments. There are probably good reasons to break every one of these
heuristics!

* If you're writing short example code that would be overburdened by error
  handling, it's probably fine to use `unwrap` (whether that's
  [`Result::unwrap`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap),
  [`Option::unwrap`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap)
  or preferably
  [`Option::expect`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.expect)).
  Consumers of your code should know to use proper error handling. (If they
  don't, send them here!)
* If you're writing a quick 'n' dirty program, don't feel ashamed if you use
  `unwrap`. Be warned: if it winds up in someone else's hands, don't be
  surprised if they are agitated by poor error messages!
* If you're writing a quick 'n' dirty program and feel ashamed about panicking
  anyway, then use either a `String` or a `Box<Error + Send + Sync>` for your
  error type (the `Box<Error + Send + Sync>` type is because of the
  [available `From` impls](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html)).
* Otherwise, in a program, define your own error types with appropriate
  [`From`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html)
  and
  [`Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html)
  impls to make the [`try!`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try!.html)
  macro more ergonomic.
* If you're writing a library and your code can produce errors, define your own
  error type and implement the
  [`std::error::Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html)
  trait. Where appropriate, implement
  [`From`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html) to make both
  your library code and the caller's code easier to write. (Because of Rust's
  coherence rules, callers will not be able to impl `From` on your error type,
  so your library should do it.)
* Learn the combinators defined on
  [`Option`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html)
  and
  [`Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html).
  Using them exclusively can be a bit tiring at times, but I've personally
  found a healthy mix of `try!` and combinators to be quite appealing.
  `and_then`, `map` and `unwrap_or` are my favorites.

## Choosing your Guarantees {#sec--choosing-your-guarantees}


One important feature of Rust is that it lets us control the costs and guarantees
of a program.

There are various &ldquo;wrapper type&rdquo; abstractions in the Rust standard library which embody
a multitude of tradeoffs between cost, ergonomics, and guarantees. Many let one choose between
run time and compile time enforcement. This section will explain a few selected abstractions in
detail.

Before proceeding, it is highly recommended that one reads about [ownership][choosing-your-guarantees.md--ownership] and
[borrowing][choosing-your-guarantees.md--borrowing] in Rust.

[choosing-your-guarantees.md--ownership]: #sec--ownership
[choosing-your-guarantees.md--borrowing]: #sec--references-and-borrowing

### Basic pointer types

#### `Box<T>`

[`Box<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--box] is an &ldquo;owned&rdquo; pointer, or a &ldquo;box&rdquo;. While it can hand
out references to the contained data, it is the only owner of the data. In particular, consider
the following:

```rust
let x = Box::new(1);
let y = x;
// x no longer accessible here
```

Here, the box was _moved_ into `y`. As `x` no longer owns it, the compiler will no longer allow the
programmer to use `x` after this. A box can similarly be moved _out_ of a function by returning it.

When a box (that hasn't been moved) goes out of scope, destructors are run. These destructors take
care of deallocating the inner data.

This is a zero-cost abstraction for dynamic allocation. If you want to allocate some memory on the
heap and safely pass around a pointer to that memory, this is ideal. Note that you will only be
allowed to share references to this by the regular borrowing rules, checked at compile time.

[choosing-your-guarantees.md--box]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html

#### `&T` and `&mut T`

These are immutable and mutable references respectively. They follow the &ldquo;read-write lock&rdquo;
pattern, such that one may either have only one mutable reference to some data, or any number of
immutable ones, but not both. This guarantee is enforced at compile time, and has no visible cost at
runtime. In most cases these two pointer types suffice for sharing cheap references between sections
of code.

These pointers cannot be copied in such a way that they outlive the lifetime associated with them.

#### `*const T` and `*mut T`

These are C-like raw pointers with no lifetime or ownership attached to them. They point to
some location in memory with no other restrictions. The only guarantee that these provide is that
they cannot be dereferenced except in code marked `unsafe`.

These are useful when building safe, low cost abstractions like `Vec<T>`, but should be avoided in
safe code.

#### `Rc<T>`

This is the first wrapper we will cover that has a runtime cost.

[`Rc<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--rc] is a reference counted pointer. In other words, this lets us have multiple "owning"
pointers to the same data, and the data will be dropped (destructors will be run) when all pointers
are out of scope.

Internally, it contains a shared &ldquo;reference count&rdquo; (also called &ldquo;refcount&rdquo;),
which is incremented each time the `Rc` is cloned, and decremented each time one of the `Rc`s goes
out of scope. The main responsibility of `Rc<T>` is to ensure that destructors are called for shared
data.

The internal data here is immutable, and if a cycle of references is created, the data will be
leaked. If we want data that doesn't leak when there are cycles, we need a garbage collector.

###### Guarantees

The main guarantee provided here is that the data will not be destroyed until all references to it
are out of scope.

This should be used when we wish to dynamically allocate and share some data (read-only) between
various portions of your program, where it is not certain which portion will finish using the pointer
last. It's a viable alternative to `&T` when `&T` is either impossible to statically check for
correctness, or creates extremely unergonomic code where the programmer does not wish to spend the
development cost of working with.

This pointer is _not_ thread safe, and Rust will not let it be sent or shared with other threads.
This lets one avoid the cost of atomics in situations where they are unnecessary.

There is a sister smart pointer to this one, `Weak<T>`. This is a non-owning, but also non-borrowed,
smart pointer. It is also similar to `&T`, but it is not restricted in lifetime&mdash;a `Weak<T>`
can be held on to forever. However, it is possible that an attempt to access the inner data may fail
and return `None`, since this can outlive the owned `Rc`s. This is useful for cyclic
data structures and other things.

###### Cost

As far as memory goes, `Rc<T>` is a single allocation, though it will allocate two extra words (i.e.
two `usize` values) as compared to a regular `Box<T>` (for "strong" and "weak" refcounts).

`Rc<T>` has the computational cost of incrementing/decrementing the refcount whenever it is cloned
or goes out of scope respectively. Note that a clone will not do a deep copy, rather it will simply
increment the inner reference count and return a copy of the `Rc<T>`.

[choosing-your-guarantees.md--rc]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html

### Cell types

`Cell`s provide interior mutability. In other words, they contain data which can be manipulated even
if the type cannot be obtained in a mutable form (for example, when it is behind an `&`-ptr or
`Rc<T>`).

[The documentation for the `cell` module has a pretty good explanation for these][choosing-your-guarantees.md--cell-mod].

These types are _generally_ found in struct fields, but they may be found elsewhere too.

#### `Cell<T>`

[`Cell<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--cell] is a type that provides zero-cost interior mutability, but only for `Copy` types.
Since the compiler knows that all the data owned by the contained value is on the stack, there's
no worry of leaking any data behind references (or worse!) by simply replacing the data.

It is still possible to violate your own invariants using this wrapper, so be careful when using it.
If a field is wrapped in `Cell`, it's a nice indicator that the chunk of data is mutable and may not
stay the same between the time you first read it and when you intend to use it.

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

let x = Cell::new(1);
let y = &x;
let z = &x;
x.set(2);
y.set(3);
z.set(4);
println!("{}", x.get());
```

Note that here we were able to mutate the same value from various immutable references.

This has the same runtime cost as the following:

```rust
let mut x = 1;
let y = &mut x;
let z = &mut x;
x = 2;
*y = 3;
*z = 4;
println!("{}", x);
```

but it has the added benefit of actually compiling successfully.

###### Guarantees

This relaxes the &ldquo;no aliasing with mutability&rdquo; restriction in places where it's
unnecessary. However, this also relaxes the guarantees that the restriction provides; so if your
invariants depend on data stored within `Cell`, you should be careful.

This is useful for mutating primitives and other `Copy` types when there is no easy way of
doing it in line with the static rules of `&` and `&mut`.

`Cell` does not let you obtain interior references to the data, which makes it safe to freely
mutate.

###### Cost

There is no runtime cost to using `Cell<T>`, however if you are using it to wrap larger (`Copy`)
structs, it might be worthwhile to instead wrap individual fields in `Cell<T>` since each write is
otherwise a full copy of the struct.


#### `RefCell<T>`

[`RefCell<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--refcell] also provides interior mutability, but isn't restricted to `Copy` types.

Instead, it has a runtime cost. `RefCell<T>` enforces the read-write lock pattern at runtime (it's
like a single-threaded mutex), unlike `&T`/`&mut T` which do so at compile time. This is done by the
`borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` functions, which modify an internal reference count and return smart
pointers which can be dereferenced immutably and mutably respectively. The refcount is restored when
the smart pointers go out of scope. With this system, we can dynamically ensure that there are never
any other borrows active when a mutable borrow is active. If the programmer attempts to make such a
borrow, the thread will panic.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let x = RefCell::new(vec![1,2,3,4]);
{
    println!("{:?}", *x.borrow())
}

{
    let mut my_ref = x.borrow_mut();
    my_ref.push(1);
}
```

Similar to `Cell`, this is mainly useful for situations where it's hard or impossible to satisfy the
borrow checker. Generally we know that such mutations won't happen in a nested form, but it's good
to check.

For large, complicated programs, it becomes useful to put some things in `RefCell`s to make things
simpler. For example, a lot of the maps in [the `ctxt` struct][choosing-your-guarantees.md--ctxt] in the Rust compiler internals
are inside this wrapper. These are only modified once (during creation, which is not right after
initialization) or a couple of times in well-separated places. However, since this struct is
pervasively used everywhere, juggling mutable and immutable pointers would be hard (perhaps
impossible) and probably form a soup of `&`-ptrs which would be hard to extend. On the other hand,
the `RefCell` provides a cheap (not zero-cost) way of safely accessing these. In the future, if
someone adds some code that attempts to modify the cell when it's already borrowed, it will cause a
(usually deterministic) panic which can be traced back to the offending borrow.

Similarly, in Servo's DOM there is a lot of mutation, most of which is local to a DOM type, but some
of which crisscrosses the DOM and modifies various things. Using `RefCell` and `Cell` to guard all
mutation lets us avoid worrying about mutability everywhere, and it simultaneously highlights the
places where mutation is _actually_ happening.

Note that `RefCell` should be avoided if a mostly simple solution is possible with `&` pointers.

###### Guarantees

`RefCell` relaxes the _static_ restrictions preventing aliased mutation, and replaces them with
_dynamic_ ones. As such the guarantees have not changed.

###### Cost

`RefCell` does not allocate, but it contains an additional "borrow state"
indicator (one word in size) along with the data.

At runtime each borrow causes a modification/check of the refcount.

[choosing-your-guarantees.md--cell]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html
[choosing-your-guarantees.md--refcell]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html
[choosing-your-guarantees.md--ctxt]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/middle/ty/struct.ctxt.html

### Synchronous types

Many of the types above cannot be used in a threadsafe manner. Particularly, `Rc<T>` and
`RefCell<T>`, which both use non-atomic reference counts (_atomic_ reference counts are those which
can be incremented from multiple threads without causing a data race), cannot be used this way. This
makes them cheaper to use, but we need thread safe versions of these too. They exist, in the form of
`Arc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`/`RwLock<T>`

Note that the non-threadsafe types _cannot_ be sent between threads, and this is checked at compile
time.

There are many useful wrappers for concurrent programming in the [sync][choosing-your-guarantees.md--sync] module, but only the
major ones will be covered below.

[choosing-your-guarantees.md--sync]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/index.html

#### `Arc<T>`

[`Arc<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--arc] is a version of `Rc<T>` that uses an atomic reference count (hence, "Arc").
This can be sent freely between threads.

C++'s `shared_ptr` is similar to `Arc`, however in the case of C++ the inner data is always mutable.
For semantics similar to that from C++, we should use `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, `Arc<RwLock<T>>`, or
`Arc<UnsafeCell<T>>`[^choosing-your-guarantees.md--4] (`UnsafeCell<T>` is a cell type that can be used to hold any data and has
no runtime cost, but accessing it requires `unsafe` blocks). The last one should only be used if we
are certain that the usage won't cause any memory unsafety. Remember that writing to a struct is not
an atomic operation, and many functions like `vec.push()` can reallocate internally and cause unsafe
behavior, so even monotonicity may not be enough to justify `UnsafeCell`.

[^choosing-your-guarantees.md--4]: `Arc<UnsafeCell<T>>` actually won't compile since `UnsafeCell<T>` isn't `Send` or `Sync`, but we can wrap it in a type and implement `Send`/`Sync` for it manually to get `Arc<Wrapper<T>>` where `Wrapper` is `struct Wrapper<T>(UnsafeCell<T>)`.

###### Guarantees

Like `Rc`, this provides the (thread safe) guarantee that the destructor for the internal data will
be run when the last `Arc` goes out of scope (barring any cycles).

###### Cost

This has the added cost of using atomics for changing the refcount (which will happen whenever it is
cloned or goes out of scope). When sharing data from an `Arc` in a single thread, it is preferable
to share `&` pointers whenever possible.

[choosing-your-guarantees.md--arc]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html

#### `Mutex<T>` and `RwLock<T>`

[`Mutex<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--mutex] and [`RwLock<T>`][choosing-your-guarantees.md--rwlock] provide mutual-exclusion via RAII guards (guards are
objects which maintain some state, like a lock, until their destructor is called). For both of
these, the mutex is opaque until we call `lock()` on it, at which point the thread will block
until a lock can be acquired, and then a guard will be returned. This guard can be used to access
the inner data (mutably), and the lock will be released when the guard goes out of scope.

```rust
{
    let guard = mutex.lock();
    // guard dereferences mutably to the inner type
    *guard += 1;
} // lock released when destructor runs
```


`RwLock` has the added benefit of being efficient for multiple reads. It is always safe to have
multiple readers to shared data as long as there are no writers; and `RwLock` lets readers acquire a
"read lock". Such locks can be acquired concurrently and are kept track of via a reference count.
Writers must obtain a "write lock" which can only be obtained when all readers have gone out of
scope.

###### Guarantees

Both of these provide safe shared mutability across threads, however they are prone to deadlocks.
Some level of additional protocol safety can be obtained via the type system.

###### Costs

These use internal atomic-like types to maintain the locks, which are pretty costly (they can block
all memory reads across processors till they're done). Waiting on these locks can also be slow when
there's a lot of concurrent access happening.

### Composition

A common gripe when reading Rust code is with types like `Rc<RefCell<Vec<T>>>` (or even more
complicated compositions of such types). It's not always clear what the composition does, or why the
author chose one like this (and when one should be using such a composition in one's own code)

Usually, it's a case of composing together the guarantees that you need, without paying for stuff
that is unnecessary.

For example, `Rc<RefCell<T>>` is one such composition. `Rc<T>` itself can't be dereferenced mutably;
because `Rc<T>` provides sharing and shared mutability can lead to unsafe behavior, so we put
`RefCell<T>` inside to get dynamically verified shared mutability. Now we have shared mutable data,
but it's shared in a way that there can only be one mutator (and no readers) or multiple readers.

Now, we can take this a step further, and have `Rc<RefCell<Vec<T>>>` or `Rc<Vec<RefCell<T>>>`. These
are both shareable, mutable vectors, but they're not the same.

With the former, the `RefCell<T>` is wrapping the `Vec<T>`, so the `Vec<T>` in its entirety is
mutable. At the same time, there can only be one mutable borrow of the whole `Vec` at a given time.
This means that your code cannot simultaneously work on different elements of the vector from
different `Rc` handles. However, we are able to push and pop from the `Vec<T>` at will. This is
similar to a `&mut Vec<T>` with the borrow checking done at runtime.

With the latter, the borrowing is of individual elements, but the overall vector is immutable. Thus,
we can independently borrow separate elements, but we cannot push or pop from the vector. This is
similar to a `&mut [T]`[^choosing-your-guarantees.md--3], but, again, the borrow checking is at runtime.

In concurrent programs, we have a similar situation with `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, which provides shared
mutability and ownership.

When reading code that uses these, go in step by step and look at the guarantees/costs provided.

When choosing a composed type, we must do the reverse; figure out which guarantees we want, and at
which point of the composition we need them. For example, if there is a choice between
`Vec<RefCell<T>>` and `RefCell<Vec<T>>`, we should figure out the tradeoffs as done above and pick
one.

[^choosing-your-guarantees.md--3]: `&[T]` and `&mut [T]` are _slices_; they consist of a pointer and a length and can refer to a portion of a vector or array. `&mut [T]` can have its elements mutated, however its length cannot be touched.


## FFI {#sec--ffi}


### Introduction

This guide will use the [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)
compression/decompression library as an introduction to writing bindings for
foreign code. Rust is currently unable to call directly into a C++ library, but
snappy includes a C interface (documented in
[`snappy-c.h`](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/snappy-c.h)).

#### A note about libc

Many of these examples use [the `libc` crate][ffi.md--libc], which provides various
type definitions for C types, among other things. If you’re trying these
examples yourself, you’ll need to add `libc` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = "0.2.0"
```

[ffi.md--libc]: https://crates.io/crates/libc

and add `extern crate libc;` to your crate root.

#### Calling foreign functions

The following is a minimal example of calling a foreign function which will
compile if snappy is installed:

```no_run
# #![feature(libc)]
extern crate libc;
use libc::size_t;

#[link(name = "snappy")]
extern {
    fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t;
}

fn main() {
    let x = unsafe { snappy_max_compressed_length(100) };
    println!("max compressed length of a 100 byte buffer: {}", x);
}
```

The `extern` block is a list of function signatures in a foreign library, in
this case with the platform's C ABI. The `#[link(...)]` attribute is used to
instruct the linker to link against the snappy library so the symbols are
resolved.

Foreign functions are assumed to be unsafe so calls to them need to be wrapped
with `unsafe {}` as a promise to the compiler that everything contained within
truly is safe. C libraries often expose interfaces that aren't thread-safe, and
almost any function that takes a pointer argument isn't valid for all possible
inputs since the pointer could be dangling, and raw pointers fall outside of
Rust's safe memory model.

When declaring the argument types to a foreign function, the Rust compiler can
not check if the declaration is correct, so specifying it correctly is part of
keeping the binding correct at runtime.

The `extern` block can be extended to cover the entire snappy API:

```no_run
# #![feature(libc)]
extern crate libc;
use libc::{c_int, size_t};

#[link(name = "snappy")]
extern {
    fn snappy_compress(input: *const u8,
                       input_length: size_t,
                       compressed: *mut u8,
                       compressed_length: *mut size_t) -> c_int;
    fn snappy_uncompress(compressed: *const u8,
                         compressed_length: size_t,
                         uncompressed: *mut u8,
                         uncompressed_length: *mut size_t) -> c_int;
    fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t;
    fn snappy_uncompressed_length(compressed: *const u8,
                                  compressed_length: size_t,
                                  result: *mut size_t) -> c_int;
    fn snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(compressed: *const u8,
                                         compressed_length: size_t) -> c_int;
}
# fn main() {}
```

### Creating a safe interface

The raw C API needs to be wrapped to provide memory safety and make use of higher-level concepts
like vectors. A library can choose to expose only the safe, high-level interface and hide the unsafe
internal details.

Wrapping the functions which expect buffers involves using the `slice::raw` module to manipulate Rust
vectors as pointers to memory. Rust's vectors are guaranteed to be a contiguous block of memory. The
length is number of elements currently contained, and the capacity is the total size in elements of
the allocated memory. The length is less than or equal to the capacity.

```rust
pub fn validate_compressed_buffer(src: &[u8]) -> bool {
    unsafe {
        snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(src.as_ptr(), src.len() as size_t) == 0
    }
}
```

The `validate_compressed_buffer` wrapper above makes use of an `unsafe` block, but it makes the
guarantee that calling it is safe for all inputs by leaving off `unsafe` from the function
signature.

The `snappy_compress` and `snappy_uncompress` functions are more complex, since a buffer has to be
allocated to hold the output too.

The `snappy_max_compressed_length` function can be used to allocate a vector with the maximum
required capacity to hold the compressed output. The vector can then be passed to the
`snappy_compress` function as an output parameter. An output parameter is also passed to retrieve
the true length after compression for setting the length.

```rust
pub fn compress(src: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    unsafe {
        let srclen = src.len() as size_t;
        let psrc = src.as_ptr();

        let mut dstlen = snappy_max_compressed_length(srclen);
        let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(dstlen as usize);
        let pdst = dst.as_mut_ptr();

        snappy_compress(psrc, srclen, pdst, &mut dstlen);
        dst.set_len(dstlen as usize);
        dst
    }
}
```

Decompression is similar, because snappy stores the uncompressed size as part of the compression
format and `snappy_uncompressed_length` will retrieve the exact buffer size required.

```rust
pub fn uncompress(src: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
    unsafe {
        let srclen = src.len() as size_t;
        let psrc = src.as_ptr();

        let mut dstlen: size_t = 0;
        snappy_uncompressed_length(psrc, srclen, &mut dstlen);

        let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(dstlen as usize);
        let pdst = dst.as_mut_ptr();

        if snappy_uncompress(psrc, srclen, pdst, &mut dstlen) == 0 {
            dst.set_len(dstlen as usize);
            Some(dst)
        } else {
            None // SNAPPY_INVALID_INPUT
        }
    }
}
```

For reference, the examples used here are also available as a [library on
GitHub](https://github.com/thestinger/rust-snappy).

### Destructors

Foreign libraries often hand off ownership of resources to the calling code.
When this occurs, we must use Rust's destructors to provide safety and guarantee
the release of these resources (especially in the case of panic).

For more about destructors, see the [Drop trait](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html).

### Callbacks from C code to Rust functions

Some external libraries require the usage of callbacks to report back their
current state or intermediate data to the caller.
It is possible to pass functions defined in Rust to an external library.
The requirement for this is that the callback function is marked as `extern`
with the correct calling convention to make it callable from C code.

The callback function can then be sent through a registration call
to the C library and afterwards be invoked from there.

A basic example is:

Rust code:

```no_run
extern fn callback(a: i32) {
    println!("I'm called from C with value {0}", a);
}

#[link(name = "extlib")]
extern {
   fn register_callback(cb: extern fn(i32)) -> i32;
   fn trigger_callback();
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        register_callback(callback);
        trigger_callback(); // Triggers the callback
    }
}
```

C code:

```c
typedef void (*rust_callback)(int32_t);
rust_callback cb;

int32_t register_callback(rust_callback callback) {
    cb = callback;
    return 1;
}

void trigger_callback() {
  cb(7); // Will call callback(7) in Rust
}
```

In this example Rust's `main()` will call `trigger_callback()` in C,
which would, in turn, call back to `callback()` in Rust.


#### Targeting callbacks to Rust objects

The former example showed how a global function can be called from C code.
However it is often desired that the callback is targeted to a special
Rust object. This could be the object that represents the wrapper for the
respective C object.

This can be achieved by passing an raw pointer to the object down to the
C library. The C library can then include the pointer to the Rust object in
the notification. This will allow the callback to unsafely access the
referenced Rust object.

Rust code:

```no_run
#[repr(C)]
struct RustObject {
    a: i32,
    // other members
}

extern "C" fn callback(target: *mut RustObject, a: i32) {
    println!("I'm called from C with value {0}", a);
    unsafe {
        // Update the value in RustObject with the value received from the callback
        (*target).a = a;
    }
}

#[link(name = "extlib")]
extern {
   fn register_callback(target: *mut RustObject,
                        cb: extern fn(*mut RustObject, i32)) -> i32;
   fn trigger_callback();
}

fn main() {
    // Create the object that will be referenced in the callback
    let mut rust_object = Box::new(RustObject { a: 5 });

    unsafe {
        register_callback(&mut *rust_object, callback);
        trigger_callback();
    }
}
```

C code:

```c
typedef void (*rust_callback)(void*, int32_t);
void* cb_target;
rust_callback cb;

int32_t register_callback(void* callback_target, rust_callback callback) {
    cb_target = callback_target;
    cb = callback;
    return 1;
}

void trigger_callback() {
  cb(cb_target, 7); // Will call callback(&rustObject, 7) in Rust
}
```

#### Asynchronous callbacks

In the previously given examples the callbacks are invoked as a direct reaction
to a function call to the external C library.
The control over the current thread is switched from Rust to C to Rust for the
execution of the callback, but in the end the callback is executed on the
same thread that called the function which triggered the callback.

Things get more complicated when the external library spawns its own threads
and invokes callbacks from there.
In these cases access to Rust data structures inside the callbacks is
especially unsafe and proper synchronization mechanisms must be used.
Besides classical synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, one possibility in
Rust is to use channels (in `std::sync::mpsc`) to forward data from the C
thread that invoked the callback into a Rust thread.

If an asynchronous callback targets a special object in the Rust address space
it is also absolutely necessary that no more callbacks are performed by the
C library after the respective Rust object gets destroyed.
This can be achieved by unregistering the callback in the object's
destructor and designing the library in a way that guarantees that no
callback will be performed after deregistration.

### Linking

The `link` attribute on `extern` blocks provides the basic building block for
instructing rustc how it will link to native libraries. There are two accepted
forms of the link attribute today:

* `#[link(name = "foo")]`
* `#[link(name = "foo", kind = "bar")]`

In both of these cases, `foo` is the name of the native library that we're
linking to, and in the second case `bar` is the type of native library that the
compiler is linking to. There are currently three known types of native
libraries:

* Dynamic - `#[link(name = "readline")]`
* Static - `#[link(name = "my_build_dependency", kind = "static")]`
* Frameworks - `#[link(name = "CoreFoundation", kind = "framework")]`

Note that frameworks are only available on OSX targets.

The different `kind` values are meant to differentiate how the native library
participates in linkage. From a linkage perspective, the Rust compiler creates
two flavors of artifacts: partial (rlib/staticlib) and final (dylib/binary).
Native dynamic library and framework dependencies are propagated to the final
artifact boundary, while static library dependencies are not propagated at
all, because the static libraries are integrated directly into the subsequent
artifact.

A few examples of how this model can be used are:

* A native build dependency. Sometimes some C/C++ glue is needed when writing
  some Rust code, but distribution of the C/C++ code in a library format is
  a burden. In this case, the code will be archived into `libfoo.a` and then the
  Rust crate would declare a dependency via `#[link(name = "foo", kind =
  "static")]`.

  Regardless of the flavor of output for the crate, the native static library
  will be included in the output, meaning that distribution of the native static
  library is not necessary.

* A normal dynamic dependency. Common system libraries (like `readline`) are
  available on a large number of systems, and often a static copy of these
  libraries cannot be found. When this dependency is included in a Rust crate,
  partial targets (like rlibs) will not link to the library, but when the rlib
  is included in a final target (like a binary), the native library will be
  linked in.

On OSX, frameworks behave with the same semantics as a dynamic library.

### Unsafe blocks

Some operations, like dereferencing raw pointers or calling functions that have been marked
unsafe are only allowed inside unsafe blocks. Unsafe blocks isolate unsafety and are a promise to
the compiler that the unsafety does not leak out of the block.

Unsafe functions, on the other hand, advertise it to the world. An unsafe function is written like
this:

```rust
unsafe fn kaboom(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 { *ptr }
```

This function can only be called from an `unsafe` block or another `unsafe` function.

### Accessing foreign globals

Foreign APIs often export a global variable which could do something like track
global state. In order to access these variables, you declare them in `extern`
blocks with the `static` keyword:

```no_run
# #![feature(libc)]
extern crate libc;

#[link(name = "readline")]
extern {
    static rl_readline_version: libc::c_int;
}

fn main() {
    println!("You have readline version {} installed.",
             rl_readline_version as i32);
}
```

Alternatively, you may need to alter global state provided by a foreign
interface. To do this, statics can be declared with `mut` so we can mutate
them.

```no_run
# #![feature(libc)]
extern crate libc;

use std::ffi::CString;
use std::ptr;

#[link(name = "readline")]
extern {
    static mut rl_prompt: *const libc::c_char;
}

fn main() {
    let prompt = CString::new("[my-awesome-shell] $").unwrap();
    unsafe {
        rl_prompt = prompt.as_ptr();

        println!("{:?}", rl_prompt);

        rl_prompt = ptr::null();
    }
}
```

Note that all interaction with a `static mut` is unsafe, both reading and
writing. Dealing with global mutable state requires a great deal of care.

### Foreign calling conventions

Most foreign code exposes a C ABI, and Rust uses the platform's C calling convention by default when
calling foreign functions. Some foreign functions, most notably the Windows API, use other calling
conventions. Rust provides a way to tell the compiler which convention to use:

```rust
extern crate libc;

#[cfg(all(target_os = "win32", target_arch = "x86"))]
#[link(name = "kernel32")]
#[allow(non_snake_case)]
extern "stdcall" {
    fn SetEnvironmentVariableA(n: *const u8, v: *const u8) -> libc::c_int;
}
```

This applies to the entire `extern` block. The list of supported ABI constraints
are:

* `stdcall`
* `aapcs`
* `cdecl`
* `fastcall`
* `vectorcall`
This is currently hidden behind the `abi_vectorcall` gate and is subject to change.
* `Rust`
* `rust-intrinsic`
* `system`
* `C`
* `win64`

Most of the abis in this list are self-explanatory, but the `system` abi may
seem a little odd. This constraint selects whatever the appropriate ABI is for
interoperating with the target's libraries. For example, on win32 with a x86
architecture, this means that the abi used would be `stdcall`. On x86_64,
however, windows uses the `C` calling convention, so `C` would be used. This
means that in our previous example, we could have used `extern "system" { ... }`
to define a block for all windows systems, not only x86 ones.

### Interoperability with foreign code

Rust guarantees that the layout of a `struct` is compatible with the platform's
representation in C only if the `#[repr(C)]` attribute is applied to it.
`#[repr(C, packed)]` can be used to lay out struct members without padding.
`#[repr(C)]` can also be applied to an enum.

Rust's owned boxes (`Box<T>`) use non-nullable pointers as handles which point
to the contained object. However, they should not be manually created because
they are managed by internal allocators. References can safely be assumed to be
non-nullable pointers directly to the type.  However, breaking the borrow
checking or mutability rules is not guaranteed to be safe, so prefer using raw
pointers (`*`) if that's needed because the compiler can't make as many
assumptions about them.

Vectors and strings share the same basic memory layout, and utilities are
available in the `vec` and `str` modules for working with C APIs. However,
strings are not terminated with `\0`. If you need a NUL-terminated string for
interoperability with C, you should use the `CString` type in the `std::ffi`
module.

The [`libc` crate on crates.io][ffi.md--libc] includes type aliases and function
definitions for the C standard library in the `libc` module, and Rust links
against `libc` and `libm` by default.

### The "nullable pointer optimization"

Certain types are defined to not be `null`. This includes references (`&T`,
`&mut T`), boxes (`Box<T>`), and function pointers (`extern "abi" fn()`).
When interfacing with C, pointers that might be null are often used.
As a special case, a generic `enum` that contains exactly two variants, one of
which contains no data and the other containing a single field, is eligible
for the "nullable pointer optimization". When such an enum is instantiated
with one of the non-nullable types, it is represented as a single pointer,
and the non-data variant is represented as the null pointer. So
`Option<extern "C" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is how one represents a nullable
function pointer using the C ABI.

### Calling Rust code from C

You may wish to compile Rust code in a way so that it can be called from C. This is
fairly easy, but requires a few things:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn hello_rust() -> *const u8 {
    "Hello, world!\0".as_ptr()
}
```

The `extern` makes this function adhere to the C calling convention, as
discussed above in "[Foreign Calling
Conventions](#foreign-calling-conventions)". The `no_mangle`
attribute turns off Rust's name mangling, so that it is easier to link to.

### FFI and panics

It’s important to be mindful of `panic!`s when working with FFI. A `panic!`
across an FFI boundary is undefined behavior. If you’re writing code that may
panic, you should run it in another thread, so that the panic doesn’t bubble up
to C:

```rust
use std::thread;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn oh_no() -> i32 {
    let h = thread::spawn(|| {
        panic!("Oops!");
    });

    match h.join() {
        Ok(_) => 1,
        Err(_) => 0,
    }
}
```

### Representing opaque structs

Sometimes, a C library wants to provide a pointer to something, but not let you
know the internal details of the thing it wants. The simplest way is to use a
`void *` argument:

```c
void foo(void *arg);
void bar(void *arg);
```

We can represent this in Rust with the `c_void` type:

```rust
extern crate libc;

extern "C" {
    pub fn foo(arg: *mut libc::c_void);
    pub fn bar(arg: *mut libc::c_void);
}
```

This is a perfectly valid way of handling the situation. However, we can do a bit
better. To solve this, some C libraries will instead create a `struct`, where
the details and memory layout of the struct are private. This gives some amount
of type safety. These structures are called ‘opaque’. Here’s an example, in C:

```c
struct Foo; /* Foo is a structure, but its contents are not part of the public interfa
↳ ce */
struct Bar;
void foo(struct Foo *arg);
void bar(struct Bar *arg);
```

To do this in Rust, let’s create our own opaque types with `enum`:

```rust
pub enum Foo {}
pub enum Bar {}

extern "C" {
    pub fn foo(arg: *mut Foo);
    pub fn bar(arg: *mut Bar);
}
```

By using an `enum` with no variants, we create an opaque type that we can’t
instantiate, as it has no variants. But because our `Foo` and `Bar` types are
different, we’ll get type safety between the two of them, so we cannot
accidentally pass a pointer to `Foo` to `bar()`.


## Borrow and AsRef {#sec--borrow-and-asref}


The [`Borrow`][borrow-and-asref.md--borrow] and [`AsRef`][borrow-and-asref.md--asref] traits are very similar, but
different. Here’s a quick refresher on what these two traits mean.

[borrow-and-asref.md--borrow]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html
[borrow-and-asref.md--asref]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html

### Borrow

The `Borrow` trait is used when you’re writing a datastructure, and you want to
use either an owned or borrowed type as synonymous for some purpose.

For example, [`HashMap`][borrow-and-asref.md--hashmap] has a [`get` method][borrow-and-asref.md--get] which uses `Borrow`:

```rust
fn get<Q: ?Sized>(&self, k: &Q) -> Option<&V>
    where K: Borrow<Q>,
          Q: Hash + Eq
```

[borrow-and-asref.md--hashmap]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html
[borrow-and-asref.md--get]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.get

This signature is pretty complicated. The `K` parameter is what we’re interested
in here. It refers to a parameter of the `HashMap` itself:

```rust
struct HashMap<K, V, S = RandomState> {
```

The `K` parameter is the type of _key_ the `HashMap` uses. So, looking at
the signature of `get()` again, we can use `get()` when the key implements
`Borrow<Q>`. That way, we can make a `HashMap` which uses `String` keys,
but use `&str`s when we’re searching:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert("Foo".to_string(), 42);

assert_eq!(map.get("Foo"), Some(&42));
```

This is because the standard library has `impl Borrow<str> for String`.

For most types, when you want to take an owned or borrowed type, a `&T` is
enough. But one area where `Borrow` is effective is when there’s more than one
kind of borrowed value. This is especially true of references and slices: you
can have both an `&T` or a `&mut T`. If we wanted to accept both of these types,
`Borrow` is up for it:

```rust
use std::borrow::Borrow;
use std::fmt::Display;

fn foo<T: Borrow<i32> + Display>(a: T) {
    println!("a is borrowed: {}", a);
}

let mut i = 5;

foo(&i);
foo(&mut i);
```

This will print out `a is borrowed: 5` twice.

### AsRef

The `AsRef` trait is a conversion trait. It’s used for converting some value to
a reference in generic code. Like this:

```rust
let s = "Hello".to_string();

fn foo<T: AsRef<str>>(s: T) {
    let slice = s.as_ref();
}
```

### Which should I use?

We can see how they’re kind of the same: they both deal with owned and borrowed
versions of some type. However, they’re a bit different.

Choose `Borrow` when you want to abstract over different kinds of borrowing, or
when you’re building a datastructure that treats owned and borrowed values in
equivalent ways, such as hashing and comparison.

Choose `AsRef` when you want to convert something to a reference directly, and
you’re writing generic code.


## Release Channels {#sec--release-channels}


The Rust project uses a concept called ‘release channels’ to manage releases.
It’s important to understand this process to choose which version of Rust
your project should use.

### Overview

There are three channels for Rust releases:

* Nightly
* Beta
* Stable

New nightly releases are created once a day. Every six weeks, the latest
nightly release is promoted to ‘Beta’. At that point, it will only receive
patches to fix serious errors. Six weeks later, the beta is promoted to
‘Stable’, and becomes the next release of `1.x`.

This process happens in parallel. So every six weeks, on the same day,
nightly goes to beta, beta goes to stable. When `1.x` is released, at
the same time, `1.(x + 1)-beta` is released, and the nightly becomes the
first version of `1.(x + 2)-nightly`.

### Choosing a version

Generally speaking, unless you have a specific reason, you should be using the
stable release channel. These releases are intended for a general audience.

However, depending on your interest in Rust, you may choose to use nightly
instead. The basic tradeoff is this: in the nightly channel, you can use
unstable, new Rust features. However, unstable features are subject to change,
and so any new nightly release may break your code. If you use the stable
release, you cannot use experimental features, but the next release of Rust
will not cause significant issues through breaking changes.

### Helping the ecosystem through CI

What about beta? We encourage all Rust users who use the stable release channel
to also test against the beta channel in their continuous integration systems.
This will help alert the team in case there’s an accidental regression.

Additionally, testing against nightly can catch regressions even sooner, and so
if you don’t mind a third build, we’d appreciate testing against all channels.

As an example, many Rust programmers use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) to
test their crates, which is free for open source projects. Travis [supports
Rust directly][release-channels.md--travis], and you can use a `.travis.yml` file like this to
test on all channels:

```yaml
language: rust
rust:
  - nightly
  - beta
  - stable

matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - rust: nightly
```

[release-channels.md--travis]: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/rust/

With this configuration, Travis will test all three channels, but if something
breaks on nightly, it won’t fail your build. A similar configuration is
recommended for any CI system, check the documentation of the one you’re
using for more details.


## Using Rust without the standard library {#sec--using-rust-without-the-standard-library}


Rust’s standard library provides a lot of useful functionality, but assumes
support for various features of its host system: threads, networking, heap
allocation, and others. There are systems that do not have these features,
however, and Rust can work with those too! To do so, we tell Rust that we
don’t want to use the standard library via an attribute: `#![no_std]`.

> Note: This feature is technically stable, but there are some caveats. For
> one, you can build a `#![no_std]` _library_ on stable, but not a _binary_.
> For details on binaries without the standard library, see [the nightly
> chapter on `#![no_std]`](#sec--no-stdlib)

To use `#![no_std]`, add it to your crate root:

```rust
#![no_std]

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Much of the functionality that’s exposed in the standard library is also
available via the [`core` crate](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/). When we’re using the standard
library, Rust automatically brings `std` into scope, allowing you to use
its features without an explicit import. By the same token, when using
`#![no_std]`, Rust will bring `core` into scope for you, as well as [its
prelude](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/prelude/v1/). This means that a lot of code will Just Work:

```rust
#![no_std]

fn may_fail(failure: bool) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if failure {
        Err("this didn’t work!")
    } else {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```


# Nightly Rust {#sec--nightly-rust}


Rust provides three distribution channels for Rust: nightly, beta, and stable.
Unstable features are only available on nightly Rust. For more details on this
process, see ‘[Stability as a deliverable][nightly-rust.md--stability]’.

[nightly-rust.md--stability]: http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html

To install nightly Rust, you can use `rustup.sh`:

```bash
$ curl -s https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh -s -- --channel=nightly
```

If you're concerned about the [potential insecurity][nightly-rust.md--insecurity] of using `curl
| sh`, please keep reading and see our disclaimer below. And feel free to
use a two-step version of the installation and examine our installation script:

```bash
$ curl -f -L https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh -O
$ sh rustup.sh --channel=nightly
```

[nightly-rust.md--insecurity]: http://curlpipesh.tumblr.com

If you're on Windows, please download either the [32-bit installer][nightly-rust.md--win32] or
the [64-bit installer][nightly-rust.md--win64] and run it.

[nightly-rust.md--win32]: https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu.msi
[nightly-rust.md--win64]: https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.msi

#### Uninstalling

If you decide you don't want Rust anymore, we'll be a bit sad, but that's okay.
Not every programming language is great for everyone. Just run the uninstall
script:

```bash
$ sudo /usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh
```

If you used the Windows installer, re-run the `.msi` and it will give you
an uninstall option.

Some people, and somewhat rightfully so, get very upset when we tell you to
`curl | sh`. Basically, when you do this, you are trusting that the good
people who maintain Rust aren't going to hack your computer and do bad things.
That's a good instinct! If you're one of those people, please check out the
documentation on [building Rust from Source][nightly-rust.md--from-source], or [the official
binary downloads][nightly-rust.md--install-page].

[nightly-rust.md--from-source]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#building-from-source
[nightly-rust.md--install-page]: https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html

Oh, we should also mention the officially supported platforms:

* Windows (7, 8, Server 2008 R2)
* Linux (2.6.18 or later, various distributions), x86 and x86-64
* OSX 10.7 (Lion) or greater, x86 and x86-64

We extensively test Rust on these platforms, and a few others, too, like
Android. But these are the ones most likely to work, as they have the most
testing.

Finally, a comment about Windows. Rust considers Windows to be a first-class
platform upon release, but if we're honest, the Windows experience isn't as
integrated as the Linux/OS X experience is. We're working on it! If anything
does not work, it is a bug. Please let us know if that happens. Each and every
commit is tested against Windows like any other platform.

If you've got Rust installed, you can open up a shell, and type this:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, commit date and build date:

```bash
rustc 1.0.0-nightly (f11f3e7ba 2015-01-04) (built 2015-01-06)
```

If you did, Rust has been installed successfully! Congrats!

This installer also installs a copy of the documentation locally, so you can
read it offline. On UNIX systems, `/usr/local/share/doc/rust` is the location.
On Windows, it's in a `share/doc` directory, inside wherever you installed Rust
to.

If not, there are a number of places where you can get help. The easiest is
[the #rust IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org][nightly-rust.md--irc], which you can access through
[Mibbit][nightly-rust.md--mibbit]. Click that link, and you'll be chatting with other Rustaceans
(a silly nickname we call ourselves), and we can help you out. Other great
resources include [the user’s forum][nightly-rust.md--users], and [Stack Overflow][nightly-rust.md--stackoverflow].

## Compiler Plugins {#sec--compiler-plugins}


### Introduction

`rustc` can load compiler plugins, which are user-provided libraries that
extend the compiler's behavior with new syntax extensions, lint checks, etc.

A plugin is a dynamic library crate with a designated *registrar* function that
registers extensions with `rustc`. Other crates can load these extensions using
the crate attribute `#![plugin(...)]`.  See the
[`rustc_plugin`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc_plugin/index.html) documentation for more about the
mechanics of defining and loading a plugin.

If present, arguments passed as `#![plugin(foo(... args ...))]` are not
interpreted by rustc itself.  They are provided to the plugin through the
`Registry`'s [`args` method](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc_plugin/registry/struct.Registry.html#method.args).

In the vast majority of cases, a plugin should *only* be used through
`#![plugin]` and not through an `extern crate` item.  Linking a plugin would
pull in all of libsyntax and librustc as dependencies of your crate.  This is
generally unwanted unless you are building another plugin.  The
`plugin_as_library` lint checks these guidelines.

The usual practice is to put compiler plugins in their own crate, separate from
any `macro_rules!` macros or ordinary Rust code meant to be used by consumers
of a library.

### Syntax extensions

Plugins can extend Rust's syntax in various ways. One kind of syntax extension
is the procedural macro. These are invoked the same way as [ordinary
macros](#sec--macros), but the expansion is performed by arbitrary Rust
code that manipulates [syntax trees](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ast/index.html) at
compile time.

Let's write a plugin
[`roman_numerals.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/auxiliary/roman_numerals.rs)
that implements Roman numeral integer literals.

```ignore
#![crate_type="dylib"]
#![feature(plugin_registrar, rustc_private)]

extern crate syntax;
extern crate rustc;
extern crate rustc_plugin;

use syntax::codemap::Span;
use syntax::parse::token;
use syntax::ast::TokenTree;
use syntax::ext::base::{ExtCtxt, MacResult, DummyResult, MacEager};
use syntax::ext::build::AstBuilder;  // trait for expr_usize
use rustc_plugin::Registry;

fn expand_rn(cx: &mut ExtCtxt, sp: Span, args: &[TokenTree])
        -> Box<MacResult + 'static> {

    static NUMERALS: &'static [(&'static str, usize)] = &[
        ("M", 1000), ("CM", 900), ("D", 500), ("CD", 400),
        ("C",  100), ("XC",  90), ("L",  50), ("XL",  40),
        ("X",   10), ("IX",   9), ("V",   5), ("IV",   4),
        ("I",    1)];

    if args.len() != 1 {
        cx.span_err(
            sp,
            &format!("argument should be a single identifier, but got {} arguments", a
↳ rgs.len()));
        return DummyResult::any(sp);
    }

    let text = match args[0] {
        TokenTree::Token(_, token::Ident(s, _)) => s.to_string(),
        _ => {
            cx.span_err(sp, "argument should be a single identifier");
            return DummyResult::any(sp);
        }
    };

    let mut text = &*text;
    let mut total = 0;
    while !text.is_empty() {
        match NUMERALS.iter().find(|&&(rn, _)| text.starts_with(rn)) {
            Some(&(rn, val)) => {
                total += val;
                text = &text[rn.len()..];
            }
            None => {
                cx.span_err(sp, "invalid Roman numeral");
                return DummyResult::any(sp);
            }
        }
    }

    MacEager::expr(cx.expr_usize(sp, total))
}

#[plugin_registrar]
pub fn plugin_registrar(reg: &mut Registry) {
    reg.register_macro("rn", expand_rn);
}
```

Then we can use `rn!()` like any other macro:

```ignore
#![feature(plugin)]
#![plugin(roman_numerals)]

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(rn!(MMXV), 2015);
}
```

The advantages over a simple `fn(&str) -> u32` are:

* The (arbitrarily complex) conversion is done at compile time.
* Input validation is also performed at compile time.
* It can be extended to allow use in patterns, which effectively gives
  a way to define new literal syntax for any data type.

In addition to procedural macros, you can define new
[`derive`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#derive)-like attributes and other kinds of
extensions.  See
[`Registry::register_syntax_extension`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc_plugin/registry/struct.Registry.html#method.register_syntax_extension)
and the [`SyntaxExtension`
enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/base/enum.SyntaxExtension.html).  For
a more involved macro example, see
[`regex_macros`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/regex_macros/src/lib.rs).


#### Tips and tricks

Some of the [macro debugging tips](#debugging-macro-code) are applicable.

You can use [`syntax::parse`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/parse/index.html) to turn token trees into
higher-level syntax elements like expressions:

```ignore
fn expand_foo(cx: &mut ExtCtxt, sp: Span, args: &[TokenTree])
        -> Box<MacResult+'static> {

    let mut parser = cx.new_parser_from_tts(args);

    let expr: P<Expr> = parser.parse_expr();
```

Looking through [`libsyntax` parser
code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs)
will give you a feel for how the parsing infrastructure works.

Keep the [`Span`s](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/codemap/struct.Span.html) of
everything you parse, for better error reporting. You can wrap
[`Spanned`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/codemap/struct.Spanned.html) around
your custom data structures.

Calling
[`ExtCtxt::span_fatal`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/base/struct.ExtCtxt.html#method.span_fatal)
will immediately abort compilation. It's better to instead call
[`ExtCtxt::span_err`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/base/struct.ExtCtxt.html#method.span_err)
and return
[`DummyResult`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/base/struct.DummyResult.html),
so that the compiler can continue and find further errors.

To print syntax fragments for debugging, you can use
[`span_note`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/base/struct.ExtCtxt.html#method.span_note) together
with
[`syntax::print::pprust::*_to_string`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/print/pprust/index.html#functions).

The example above produced an integer literal using
[`AstBuilder::expr_usize`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/build/trait.AstBuilder.html#tymethod.expr_usize).
As an alternative to the `AstBuilder` trait, `libsyntax` provides a set of
[quasiquote macros](http://doc.rust-lang.org/syntax/ext/quote/index.html).  They are undocumented and
very rough around the edges.  However, the implementation may be a good
starting point for an improved quasiquote as an ordinary plugin library.


### Lint plugins

Plugins can extend [Rust's lint
infrastructure](http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#lint-check-attributes) with additional checks for
code style, safety, etc. Now let's write a plugin [`lint_plugin_test.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/auxiliary/lint_plugin_test.rs)
that warns about any item named `lintme`.

```ignore
#![feature(plugin_registrar)]
#![feature(box_syntax, rustc_private)]

extern crate syntax;

// Load rustc as a plugin to get macros
#[macro_use]
extern crate rustc;
extern crate rustc_plugin;

use rustc::lint::{EarlyContext, LintContext, LintPass, EarlyLintPass,
                  EarlyLintPassObject, LintArray};
use rustc_plugin::Registry;
use syntax::ast;

declare_lint!(TEST_LINT, Warn, "Warn about items named 'lintme'");

struct Pass;

impl LintPass for Pass {
    fn get_lints(&self) -> LintArray {
        lint_array!(TEST_LINT)
    }
}

impl EarlyLintPass for Pass {
    fn check_item(&mut self, cx: &EarlyContext, it: &ast::Item) {
        if it.ident.name.as_str() == "lintme" {
            cx.span_lint(TEST_LINT, it.span, "item is named 'lintme'");
        }
    }
}

#[plugin_registrar]
pub fn plugin_registrar(reg: &mut Registry) {
    reg.register_early_lint_pass(box Pass as EarlyLintPassObject);
}
```

Then code like

```ignore
#![plugin(lint_plugin_test)]

fn lintme() { }
```

will produce a compiler warning:

```txt
foo.rs:4:1: 4:16 warning: item is named 'lintme', #[warn(test_lint)] on by default
foo.rs:4 fn lintme() { }
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

The components of a lint plugin are:

* one or more `declare_lint!` invocations, which define static
  [`Lint`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lint/struct.Lint.html) structs;

* a struct holding any state needed by the lint pass (here, none);

* a [`LintPass`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lint/trait.LintPass.html)
  implementation defining how to check each syntax element. A single
  `LintPass` may call `span_lint` for several different `Lint`s, but should
  register them all through the `get_lints` method.

Lint passes are syntax traversals, but they run at a late stage of compilation
where type information is available. `rustc`'s [built-in
lints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs)
mostly use the same infrastructure as lint plugins, and provide examples of how
to access type information.

Lints defined by plugins are controlled by the usual [attributes and compiler
flags](http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#lint-check-attributes), e.g. `#[allow(test_lint)]` or
`-A test-lint`. These identifiers are derived from the first argument to
`declare_lint!`, with appropriate case and punctuation conversion.

You can run `rustc -W help foo.rs` to see a list of lints known to `rustc`,
including those provided by plugins loaded by `foo.rs`.


## Inline Assembly {#sec--inline-assembly}


For extremely low-level manipulations and performance reasons, one
might wish to control the CPU directly. Rust supports using inline
assembly to do this via the `asm!` macro. The syntax roughly matches
that of GCC & Clang:

```ignore
asm!(assembly template
   : output operands
   : input operands
   : clobbers
   : options
   );
```

Any use of `asm` is feature gated (requires `#![feature(asm)]` on the
crate to allow) and of course requires an `unsafe` block.

> **Note**: the examples here are given in x86/x86-64 assembly, but
> all platforms are supported.

#### Assembly template

The `assembly template` is the only required parameter and must be a
literal string (i.e. `""`)

```rust
#![feature(asm)]

#[cfg(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))]
fn foo() {
    unsafe {
        asm!("NOP");
    }
}

// other platforms
#[cfg(not(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64")))]
fn foo() { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
    // ...
    foo();
    // ...
}
```

(The `feature(asm)` and `#[cfg]`s are omitted from now on.)

Output operands, input operands, clobbers and options are all optional
but you must add the right number of `:` if you skip them:

```rust
asm!("xor %eax, %eax"
    :
    :
    : "{eax}"
   );
```

Whitespace also doesn't matter:

```rust
asm!("xor %eax, %eax" ::: "{eax}");
```

#### Operands

Input and output operands follow the same format: `:
"constraints1"(expr1), "constraints2"(expr2), ..."`. Output operand
expressions must be mutable lvalues, or not yet assigned:

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    let c: i32;
    unsafe {
        asm!("add $2, $0"
             : "=r"(c)
             : "0"(a), "r"(b)
             );
    }
    c
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(add(3, 14159), 14162)
}
```

If you would like to use real operands in this position, however,
you are required to put curly braces `{}` around the register that
you want, and you are required to put the specific size of the
operand. This is useful for very low level programming, where
which register you use is important:

```rust
let result: u8;
asm!("in %dx, %al" : "={al}"(result) : "{dx}"(port));
result
```

#### Clobbers

Some instructions modify registers which might otherwise have held
different values so we use the clobbers list to indicate to the
compiler not to assume any values loaded into those registers will
stay valid.

```rust
// Put the value 0x200 in eax
asm!("mov $$0x200, %eax" : /* no outputs */ : /* no inputs */ : "{eax}");
```

Input and output registers need not be listed since that information
is already communicated by the given constraints. Otherwise, any other
registers used either implicitly or explicitly should be listed.

If the assembly changes the condition code register `cc` should be
specified as one of the clobbers. Similarly, if the assembly modifies
memory, `memory` should also be specified.

#### Options

The last section, `options` is specific to Rust. The format is comma
separated literal strings (i.e. `:"foo", "bar", "baz"`). It's used to
specify some extra info about the inline assembly:

Current valid options are:

1. *volatile* - specifying this is analogous to
   `__asm__ __volatile__ (...)` in gcc/clang.
2. *alignstack* - certain instructions expect the stack to be
   aligned a certain way (i.e. SSE) and specifying this indicates to
   the compiler to insert its usual stack alignment code
3. *intel* - use intel syntax instead of the default AT&T.

```rust
let result: i32;
unsafe {
   asm!("mov eax, 2" : "={eax}"(result) : : : "intel")
}
println!("eax is currently {}", result);
```

#### More Information

The current implementation of the `asm!` macro is a direct binding to [LLVM's
inline assembler expressions][inline-assembly.md--llvm-docs], so be sure to check out [their
documentation as well][inline-assembly.md--llvm-docs] for more information about clobbers,
constraints, etc.

## No stdlib {#sec--no-stdlib}


Rust’s standard library provides a lot of useful functionality, but assumes
support for various features of its host system: threads, networking, heap
allocation, and others. There are systems that do not have these features,
however, and Rust can work with those too! To do so, we tell Rust that we
don’t want to use the standard library via an attribute: `#![no_std]`.

> Note: This feature is technically stable, but there are some caveats. For
> one, you can build a `#![no_std]` _library_ on stable, but not a _binary_.
> For details on libraries without the standard library, see [the chapter on
> `#![no_std]`](#sec--using-rust-without-the-standard-library)

Obviously there's more to life than just libraries: one can use
`#[no_std]` with an executable, controlling the entry point is
possible in two ways: the `#[start]` attribute, or overriding the
default shim for the C `main` function with your own.

The function marked `#[start]` is passed the command line parameters
in the same format as C:

```rust
#![feature(lang_items)]
#![feature(start)]
#![no_std]

// Pull in the system libc library for what crt0.o likely requires
extern crate libc;

// Entry point for this program
#[start]
fn start(_argc: isize, _argv: *const *const u8) -> isize {
    0
}

// These functions and traits are used by the compiler, but not
// for a bare-bones hello world. These are normally
// provided by libstd.
#[lang = "eh_personality"] extern fn eh_personality() {}
#[lang = "panic_fmt"] fn panic_fmt() -> ! { loop {} }
```

To override the compiler-inserted `main` shim, one has to disable it
with `#![no_main]` and then create the appropriate symbol with the
correct ABI and the correct name, which requires overriding the
compiler's name mangling too:

```rust
#![feature(lang_items)]
#![feature(start)]
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate libc;

#[no_mangle] // ensure that this symbol is called `main` in the output
pub extern fn main(argc: i32, argv: *const *const u8) -> i32 {
    0
}

#[lang = "eh_personality"] extern fn eh_personality() {}
#[lang = "panic_fmt"] fn panic_fmt() -> ! { loop {} }
```


The compiler currently makes a few assumptions about symbols which are available
in the executable to call. Normally these functions are provided by the standard
library, but without it you must define your own.

The first of these two functions, `eh_personality`, is used by the failure
mechanisms of the compiler. This is often mapped to GCC's personality function
(see the [libstd implementation][no-stdlib.md--unwind] for more information), but crates
which do not trigger a panic can be assured that this function is never
called. The second function, `panic_fmt`, is also used by the failure
mechanisms of the compiler.

[no-stdlib.md--unwind]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/sys/common/unwind/gcc.rs


## Intrinsics {#sec--intrinsics}


> **Note**: intrinsics will forever have an unstable interface, it is
> recommended to use the stable interfaces of libcore rather than intrinsics
> directly.

These are imported as if they were FFI functions, with the special
`rust-intrinsic` ABI. For example, if one was in a freestanding
context, but wished to be able to `transmute` between types, and
perform efficient pointer arithmetic, one would import those functions
via a declaration like

```rust
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn transmute<T, U>(x: T) -> U;

    fn offset<T>(dst: *const T, offset: isize) -> *const T;
}
```

As with any other FFI functions, these are always `unsafe` to call.



## Lang items {#sec--lang-items}


> **Note**: lang items are often provided by crates in the Rust distribution,
> and lang items themselves have an unstable interface. It is recommended to use
> officially distributed crates instead of defining your own lang items.

The `rustc` compiler has certain pluggable operations, that is,
functionality that isn't hard-coded into the language, but is
implemented in libraries, with a special marker to tell the compiler
it exists. The marker is the attribute `#[lang = "..."]` and there are
various different values of `...`, i.e. various different 'lang
items'.

For example, `Box` pointers require two lang items, one for allocation
and one for deallocation. A freestanding program that uses the `Box`
sugar for dynamic allocations via `malloc` and `free`:

```rust
#![feature(lang_items, box_syntax, start, libc)]
#![no_std]

extern crate libc;

extern {
    fn abort() -> !;
}

#[lang = "owned_box"]
pub struct Box<T>(*mut T);

#[lang = "exchange_malloc"]
unsafe fn allocate(size: usize, _align: usize) -> *mut u8 {
    let p = libc::malloc(size as libc::size_t) as *mut u8;

    // malloc failed
    if p as usize == 0 {
        abort();
    }

    p
}

#[lang = "exchange_free"]
unsafe fn deallocate(ptr: *mut u8, _size: usize, _align: usize) {
    libc::free(ptr as *mut libc::c_void)
}

#[lang = "box_free"]
unsafe fn box_free<T>(ptr: *mut T) {
    deallocate(ptr as *mut u8, ::core::mem::size_of::<T>(), ::core::mem::align_of::<T>
↳ ());
}

#[start]
fn main(argc: isize, argv: *const *const u8) -> isize {
    let x = box 1;

    0
}

#[lang = "eh_personality"] extern fn eh_personality() {}
#[lang = "panic_fmt"] fn panic_fmt() -> ! { loop {} }
```

Note the use of `abort`: the `exchange_malloc` lang item is assumed to
return a valid pointer, and so needs to do the check internally.

Other features provided by lang items include:

- overloadable operators via traits: the traits corresponding to the
  `==`, `<`, dereferencing (`*`) and `+` (etc.) operators are all
  marked with lang items; those specific four are `eq`, `ord`,
  `deref`, and `add` respectively.
- stack unwinding and general failure; the `eh_personality`, `fail`
  and `fail_bounds_checks` lang items.
- the traits in `std::marker` used to indicate types of
  various kinds; lang items `send`, `sync` and `copy`.
- the marker types and variance indicators found in
  `std::marker`; lang items `covariant_type`,
  `contravariant_lifetime`, etc.

Lang items are loaded lazily by the compiler; e.g. if one never uses
`Box` then there is no need to define functions for `exchange_malloc`
and `exchange_free`. `rustc` will emit an error when an item is needed
but not found in the current crate or any that it depends on.


## Advanced linking {#sec--advanced-linking}


The common cases of linking with Rust have been covered earlier in this book,
but supporting the range of linking possibilities made available by other
languages is important for Rust to achieve seamless interaction with native
libraries.

### Link args

There is one other way to tell `rustc` how to customize linking, and that is via
the `link_args` attribute. This attribute is applied to `extern` blocks and
specifies raw flags which need to get passed to the linker when producing an
artifact. An example usage would be:

``` no_run
#![feature(link_args)]

#[link_args = "-foo -bar -baz"]
extern {}
# fn main() {}
```

Note that this feature is currently hidden behind the `feature(link_args)` gate
because this is not a sanctioned way of performing linking. Right now `rustc`
shells out to the system linker (`gcc` on most systems, `link.exe` on MSVC),
so it makes sense to provide extra command line
arguments, but this will not always be the case. In the future `rustc` may use
LLVM directly to link native libraries, in which case `link_args` will have no
meaning. You can achieve the same effect as the `link_args` attribute with the
`-C link-args` argument to `rustc`.

It is highly recommended to *not* use this attribute, and rather use the more
formal `#[link(...)]` attribute on `extern` blocks instead.

### Static linking

Static linking refers to the process of creating output that contains all
required libraries and so doesn't need libraries installed on every system where
you want to use your compiled project. Pure-Rust dependencies are statically
linked by default so you can use created binaries and libraries without
installing Rust everywhere. By contrast, native libraries
(e.g. `libc` and `libm`) are usually dynamically linked, but it is possible to
change this and statically link them as well.

Linking is a very platform-dependent topic, and static linking may not even be
possible on some platforms! This section assumes some basic familiarity with
linking on your platform of choice.

#### Linux

By default, all Rust programs on Linux will link to the system `libc` along with
a number of other libraries. Let's look at an example on a 64-bit Linux machine
with GCC and `glibc` (by far the most common `libc` on Linux):

``` text
$ cat example.rs
fn main() {}
$ rustc example.rs
$ ldd example
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffd565fd000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fa81889c000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fa81867e000)
        librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0x00007fa818475000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fa81825f000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fa817e9a000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fa818cf9000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007fa817b93000)
```

Dynamic linking on Linux can be undesirable if you wish to use new library
features on old systems or target systems which do not have the required
dependencies for your program to run.

Static linking is supported via an alternative `libc`, [`musl`](http://www.musl-libc.org). You can compile
your own version of Rust with `musl` enabled and install it into a custom
directory with the instructions below:

```text
$ mkdir musldist
$ PREFIX=$(pwd)/musldist
$
$ # Build musl
$ curl -O http://www.musl-libc.org/releases/musl-1.1.10.tar.gz
$ tar xf musl-1.1.10.tar.gz
$ cd musl-1.1.10/
musl-1.1.10 $ ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=$PREFIX
musl-1.1.10 $ make
musl-1.1.10 $ make install
musl-1.1.10 $ cd ..
$ du -h musldist/lib/libc.a
2.2M    musldist/lib/libc.a
$
$ # Build libunwind.a
$ curl -O http://llvm.org/releases/3.7.0/llvm-3.7.0.src.tar.xz
$ tar xf llvm-3.7.0.src.tar.xz
$ cd llvm-3.7.0.src/projects/
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects $ curl http://llvm.org/releases/3.7.0/libunwind-3.7.0.src.tar.
↳ xz | tar xJf -
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects $ mv libunwind-3.7.0.src libunwind
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects $ mkdir libunwind/build
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects $ cd libunwind/build
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects/libunwind/build $ cmake -DLLVM_PATH=../../.. -DLIBUNWIND_ENABL
↳ E_SHARED=0 ..
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects/libunwind/build $ make
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects/libunwind/build $ cp lib/libunwind.a $PREFIX/lib/
llvm-3.7.0.src/projects/libunwind/build $ cd ../../../../
$ du -h musldist/lib/libunwind.a
164K    musldist/lib/libunwind.a
$
$ # Build musl-enabled rust
$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git muslrust
$ cd muslrust
muslrust $ ./configure --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --musl-root=$PREFIX --prefix
↳ =$PREFIX
muslrust $ make
muslrust $ make install
muslrust $ cd ..
$ du -h musldist/bin/rustc
12K     musldist/bin/rustc
```

You now have a build of a `musl`-enabled Rust! Because we've installed it to a
custom prefix we need to make sure our system can find the binaries and appropriate
libraries when we try and run it:

```text
$ export PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Let's try it out!

```text
$ echo 'fn main() { println!("hi!"); panic!("failed"); }' > example.rs
$ rustc --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl example.rs
$ ldd example
        not a dynamic executable
$ ./example
hi!
thread '<main>' panicked at 'failed', example.rs:1
```

Success! This binary can be copied to almost any Linux machine with the same
machine architecture and run without issues.

`cargo build` also permits the `--target` option so you should be able to build
your crates as normal. However, you may need to recompile your native libraries
against `musl` before they can be linked against.


## Benchmark Tests {#sec--benchmark-tests}


Rust supports benchmark tests, which can test the performance of your
code. Let's make our `src/lib.rs` look like this (comments elided):

```rust
#![feature(test)]

extern crate test;

pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use test::Bencher;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }

    #[bench]
    fn bench_add_two(b: &mut Bencher) {
        b.iter(|| add_two(2));
    }
}
```

Note the `test` feature gate, which enables this unstable feature.

We've imported the `test` crate, which contains our benchmarking support.
We have a new function as well, with the `bench` attribute. Unlike regular
tests, which take no arguments, benchmark tests take a `&mut Bencher`. This
`Bencher` provides an `iter` method, which takes a closure. This closure
contains the code we'd like to benchmark.

We can run benchmark tests with `cargo bench`:

```bash
$ cargo bench
   Compiling adder v0.0.1 (file:///home/steve/tmp/adder)
     Running target/release/adder-91b3e234d4ed382a

running 2 tests
test tests::it_works ... ignored
test tests::bench_add_two ... bench:         1 ns/iter (+/- 0)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 1 ignored; 1 measured
```

Our non-benchmark test was ignored. You may have noticed that `cargo bench`
takes a bit longer than `cargo test`. This is because Rust runs our benchmark
a number of times, and then takes the average. Because we're doing so little
work in this example, we have a `1 ns/iter (+/- 0)`, but this would show
the variance if there was one.

Advice on writing benchmarks:


* Move setup code outside the `iter` loop; only put the part you want to measure inside
* Make the code do "the same thing" on each iteration; do not accumulate or change state
* Make the outer function idempotent too; the benchmark runner is likely to run
  it many times
*  Make the inner `iter` loop short and fast so benchmark runs are fast and the
   calibrator can adjust the run-length at fine resolution
* Make the code in the `iter` loop do something simple, to assist in pinpointing
  performance improvements (or regressions)

#### Gotcha: optimizations

There's another tricky part to writing benchmarks: benchmarks compiled with
optimizations activated can be dramatically changed by the optimizer so that
the benchmark is no longer benchmarking what one expects. For example, the
compiler might recognize that some calculation has no external effects and
remove it entirely.

```rust
#![feature(test)]

extern crate test;
use test::Bencher;

#[bench]
fn bench_xor_1000_ints(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| {
        (0..1000).fold(0, |old, new| old ^ new);
    });
}
```

gives the following results

```text
running 1 test
test bench_xor_1000_ints ... bench:         0 ns/iter (+/- 0)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 1 measured
```

The benchmarking runner offers two ways to avoid this. Either, the closure that
the `iter` method receives can return an arbitrary value which forces the
optimizer to consider the result used and ensures it cannot remove the
computation entirely. This could be done for the example above by adjusting the
`b.iter` call to

```rust
b.iter(|| {
    // note lack of `;` (could also use an explicit `return`).
    (0..1000).fold(0, |old, new| old ^ new)
});
```

Or, the other option is to call the generic `test::black_box` function, which
is an opaque "black box" to the optimizer and so forces it to consider any
argument as used.

```rust
#![feature(test)]

extern crate test;

b.iter(|| {
    let n = test::black_box(1000);

    (0..n).fold(0, |a, b| a ^ b)
})
```

Neither of these read or modify the value, and are very cheap for small values.
Larger values can be passed indirectly to reduce overhead (e.g.
`black_box(&huge_struct)`).

Performing either of the above changes gives the following benchmarking results

```text
running 1 test
test bench_xor_1000_ints ... bench:       131 ns/iter (+/- 3)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 1 measured
```

However, the optimizer can still modify a testcase in an undesirable manner
even when using either of the above.


## Box Syntax and Patterns {#sec--box-syntax-and-patterns}


Currently the only stable way to create a `Box` is via the `Box::new` method.
Also it is not possible in stable Rust to destructure a `Box` in a match
pattern. The unstable `box` keyword can be used to both create and destructure
a `Box`. An example usage would be:

```rust
#![feature(box_syntax, box_patterns)]

fn main() {
    let b = Some(box 5);
    match b {
        Some(box n) if n < 0 => {
            println!("Box contains negative number {}", n);
        },
        Some(box n) if n >= 0 => {
            println!("Box contains non-negative number {}", n);
        },
        None => {
            println!("No box");
        },
        _ => unreachable!()
    }
}
```

Note that these features are currently hidden behind the `box_syntax` (box
creation) and `box_patterns` (destructuring and pattern matching) gates
because the syntax may still change in the future.

### Returning Pointers

In many languages with pointers, you'd return a pointer from a function
so as to avoid copying a large data structure. For example:

```rust
struct BigStruct {
    one: i32,
    two: i32,
    // etc
    one_hundred: i32,
}

fn foo(x: Box<BigStruct>) -> Box<BigStruct> {
    Box::new(*x)
}

fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(BigStruct {
        one: 1,
        two: 2,
        one_hundred: 100,
    });

    let y = foo(x);
}
```

The idea is that by passing around a box, you're only copying a pointer, rather
than the hundred `i32`s that make up the `BigStruct`.

This is an antipattern in Rust. Instead, write this:

```rust
#![feature(box_syntax)]

struct BigStruct {
    one: i32,
    two: i32,
    // etc
    one_hundred: i32,
}

fn foo(x: Box<BigStruct>) -> BigStruct {
    *x
}

fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(BigStruct {
        one: 1,
        two: 2,
        one_hundred: 100,
    });

    let y: Box<BigStruct> = box foo(x);
}
```

This gives you flexibility without sacrificing performance.

You may think that this gives us terrible performance: return a value and then
immediately box it up ?! Isn't this pattern the worst of both worlds? Rust is
smarter than that. There is no copy in this code. `main` allocates enough room
for the `box`, passes a pointer to that memory into `foo` as `x`, and then
`foo` writes the value straight into the `Box<T>`.

This is important enough that it bears repeating: pointers are not for
optimizing returning values from your code. Allow the caller to choose how they
want to use your output.


## Slice Patterns {#sec--slice-patterns}


If you want to match against a slice or array, you can use `&` with the
`slice_patterns` feature:

```rust
#![feature(slice_patterns)]

fn main() {
    let v = vec!["match_this", "1"];

    match &v[..] {
        ["match_this", second] => println!("The second element is {}", second),
        _ => {},
    }
}
```

The `advanced_slice_patterns` gate lets you use `..` to indicate any number of
elements inside a pattern matching a slice. This wildcard can only be used once
for a given array. If there's an identifier before the `..`, the result of the
slice will be bound to that name. For example:

```rust
#![feature(advanced_slice_patterns, slice_patterns)]

fn is_symmetric(list: &[u32]) -> bool {
    match list {
        [] | [_] => true,
        [x, inside.., y] if x == y => is_symmetric(inside),
        _ => false
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sym = &[0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0];
    assert!(is_symmetric(sym));

    let not_sym = &[0, 1, 7, 2, 4, 1, 0];
    assert!(!is_symmetric(not_sym));
}
```


## Associated Constants {#sec--associated-constants}


With the `associated_consts` feature, you can define constants like this:

```rust
#![feature(associated_consts)]

trait Foo {
    const ID: i32;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
    const ID: i32 = 1;
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(1, i32::ID);
}
```

Any implementor of `Foo` will have to define `ID`. Without the definition:

```rust
#![feature(associated_consts)]

trait Foo {
    const ID: i32;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
}
```

gives

```text
error: not all trait items implemented, missing: `ID` [E0046]
     impl Foo for i32 {
     }
```

A default value can be implemented as well:

```rust
#![feature(associated_consts)]

trait Foo {
    const ID: i32 = 1;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
}

impl Foo for i64 {
    const ID: i32 = 5;
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(1, i32::ID);
    assert_eq!(5, i64::ID);
}
```

As you can see, when implementing `Foo`, you can leave it unimplemented, as
with `i32`. It will then use the default value. But, as in `i64`, we can also
add our own definition.

Associated constants don’t have to be associated with a trait. An `impl` block
for a `struct` or an `enum` works fine too:

```rust
#![feature(associated_consts)]

struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    const FOO: u32 = 3;
}
```


## Custom Allocators {#sec--custom-allocators}


Allocating memory isn't always the easiest thing to do, and while Rust generally
takes care of this by default it often becomes necessary to customize how
allocation occurs. The compiler and standard library currently allow switching
out the default global allocator in use at compile time. The design is currently
spelled out in [RFC 1183][custom-allocators.md--rfc] but this will walk you through how to get your
own allocator up and running.

[custom-allocators.md--rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1183-swap-out-jemalloc.md

### Default Allocator

The compiler currently ships two default allocators: `alloc_system` and
`alloc_jemalloc` (some targets don't have jemalloc, however). These allocators
are normal Rust crates and contain an implementation of the routines to
allocate and deallocate memory. The standard library is not compiled assuming
either one, and the compiler will decide which allocator is in use at
compile-time depending on the type of output artifact being produced.

Binaries generated by the compiler will use `alloc_jemalloc` by default (where
available). In this situation the compiler "controls the world" in the sense of
it has power over the final link. Primarily this means that the allocator
decision can be left up the compiler.

Dynamic and static libraries, however, will use `alloc_system` by default. Here
Rust is typically a 'guest' in another application or another world where it
cannot authoritatively decide what allocator is in use. As a result it resorts
back to the standard APIs (e.g. `malloc` and `free`) for acquiring and releasing
memory.

### Switching Allocators

Although the compiler's default choices may work most of the time, it's often
necessary to tweak certain aspects. Overriding the compiler's decision about
which allocator is in use is done simply by linking to the desired allocator:

```rust
#![feature(alloc_system)]

extern crate alloc_system;

fn main() {
    let a = Box::new(4); // allocates from the system allocator
    println!("{}", a);
}
```

In this example the binary generated will not link to jemalloc by default but
instead use the system allocator. Conversely to generate a dynamic library which
uses jemalloc by default one would write:

```rust
#![feature(alloc_jemalloc)]
#![crate_type = "dylib"]

extern crate alloc_jemalloc;

pub fn foo() {
    let a = Box::new(4); // allocates from jemalloc
    println!("{}", a);
}
```

### Writing a custom allocator

Sometimes even the choices of jemalloc vs the system allocator aren't enough and
an entirely new custom allocator is required. In this you'll write your own
crate which implements the allocator API (e.g. the same as `alloc_system` or
`alloc_jemalloc`). As an example, let's take a look at a simplified and
annotated version of `alloc_system`

```rust
// The compiler needs to be instructed that this crate is an allocator in order
// to realize that when this is linked in another allocator like jemalloc should
// not be linked in
#![feature(allocator)]
#![allocator]

// Allocators are not allowed to depend on the standard library which in turn
// requires an allocator in order to avoid circular dependencies. This crate,
// however, can use all of libcore.
#![no_std]

// Let's give a unique name to our custom allocator
#![crate_name = "my_allocator"]
#![crate_type = "rlib"]

// Our system allocator will use the in-tree libc crate for FFI bindings. Note
// that currently the external (crates.io) libc cannot be used because it links
// to the standard library (e.g. `#![no_std]` isn't stable yet), so that's why
// this specifically requires the in-tree version.
#![feature(libc)]
extern crate libc;

// Listed below are the five allocation functions currently required by custom
// allocators. Their signatures and symbol names are not currently typechecked
// by the compiler, but this is a future extension and are required to match

After we compile this crate, it can be used as follows:

```rust
extern crate my_allocator;

fn main() {
    let a = Box::new(8); // allocates memory via our custom allocator crate
    println!("{}", a);
}
```

### Custom allocator limitations

There are a few restrictions when working with custom allocators which may cause
compiler errors:

* Any one artifact may only be linked to at most one allocator. Binaries,
  dylibs, and staticlibs must link to exactly one allocator, and if none have
  been explicitly chosen the compiler will choose one. On the other hand rlibs
  do not need to link to an allocator (but still can).

* A consumer of an allocator is tagged with `#![needs_allocator]` (e.g. the
  `liballoc` crate currently) and an `#[allocator]` crate cannot transitively
  depend on a crate which needs an allocator (e.g. circular dependencies are not
  allowed). This basically means that allocators must restrict themselves to
  libcore currently.


# Glossary {#sec--glossary}


Not every Rustacean has a background in systems programming, nor in computer
science, so we've added explanations of terms that might be unfamiliar.

##### Abstract Syntax Tree

When a compiler is compiling your program, it does a number of different things.
One of the things that it does is turn the text of your program into an
‘abstract syntax tree’, or ‘AST’. This tree is a representation of the structure
of your program. For example, `2 + 3` can be turned into a tree:

```text
  +
 / \
2   3
```

And `2 + (3 * 4)` would look like this:

```text
  +
 / \
2   *
   / \
  3   4
```

##### Arity

Arity refers to the number of arguments a function or operation takes.

```rust
let x = (2, 3);
let y = (4, 6);
let z = (8, 2, 6);
```

In the example above `x` and `y` have arity 2. `z` has arity 3.

##### Bounds

Bounds are constraints on a type or [trait][glossary.md--traits]. For example, if a bound
is placed on the argument a function takes, types passed to that function
must abide by that constraint.

[glossary.md--traits]: #sec--traits

##### DST (Dynamically Sized Type)

A type without a statically known size or alignment. ([more info][glossary.md--link])

[glossary.md--link]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#dynamically-sized-types-dsts

##### Expression

In computer programming, an expression is a combination of values, constants,
variables, operators and functions that evaluate to a single value. For example,
`2 + (3 * 4)` is an expression that returns the value 14. It is worth noting
that expressions can have side-effects. For example, a function included in an
expression might perform actions other than simply returning a value.

##### Expression-Oriented Language

In early programming languages, [expressions][glossary.md--expression] and
[statements][glossary.md--statement] were two separate syntactic categories: expressions had
a value and statements did things. However, later languages blurred this
distinction, allowing expressions to do things and statements to have a value.
In an expression-oriented language, (nearly) every statement is an expression
and therefore returns a value. Consequently, these expression statements can
themselves form part of larger expressions.

[glossary.md--expression]: #expression
[glossary.md--statement]: #statement

##### Statement

In computer programming, a statement is the smallest standalone element of a
programming language that commands a computer to perform an action.
