% Macros, A Methodical Introduction

This chapter will introduce Rust's Macro-By-Example system: `macro_rules!`.  Rather than trying to cover it based on practical examples, it will instead attempt to give you a complete and thorough explanation of *how* the system works.  As such, this is intended for people who just want the system as a whole explained, rather than be guided through it.

There is also the [Macros chapter of the Rust Book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/macros.html) which is a more approachable, high-level explanation, and the [practical introduction](https://danielkeep.github.io/practical-intro-to-macros.html) chapter of this book, which is a guided implementation of a single macro.
